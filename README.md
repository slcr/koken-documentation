# KOKEN DOCUMENTATION

The abandoned [koken](http://koken.me) left us with no documentation and no help whatsoever, so i decided to pull all the documentation from the beloved wayback machine to help out courageous fans that still work with koken.

**I will not give any support for this.** There will be dead links, especially in the forum part, but the theme documentation seems to work quite well so far. 

## INSTALL KOKEN
[Nick Thompson](https://github.com/nickian/) has modified the koken installer script, that you can pull and still create a clean install of koken: [Check his installer repo](https://github.com/nickian/koken-installer)
