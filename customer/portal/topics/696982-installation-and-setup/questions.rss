      <title>It Nike Lebron 11 For Sale ain't what we </title>
      <description>3 Busted Dividend Myths
"It Nike Lebron 11 For Sale ain't what we don't know that gets us in trouble. It's what we do know that just ain't so." Mark Twain
Who needs Warren Buffett to drop some sage investment knowledge on us when we've got Mark Twain at our disposal? Truth is, many of us make investment decisions based on cheap nba hats faulty premises all the time. And we pay the price, too. That's why, each Monday, we're committed to doing our part to stop the madness. So, in honor of MythBusting Monday, I'm tackling three pesky myths about dividend investing with a little help from some charts.
Dividend Myth 1: Lower Volatility = Lower ReturnsBoring. That's the quintessential gripe about dividend investments. It stems from the fact that dividend stocks tend to be much less volatile than nondividendpaying Nike Lebron 12 stocks. And, therefore, they must generate lower returns. But don't be fooled. risk) leads to lower returns "just ain't so!"
(click to enlarge)
If we look at the performance of the 1,000 largest companies by market cap over the last 50 years, the quintile that includes low and nondividend payers exhibits the greatest volatility. No big surprise there. However, the top performer is quintile 2, which includes aboveaverage dividend payers.
So, once again, we've proven that higher risk does not equal higher returns. To the contrary, lower risk often results in higher Kobe 8 For Sale returns.
Dividend Myth 2: Dividend Stocks Tank When Interest Rates RiseI know what you're thinking right now Lou. So dividend stocks offer superior returns over long periods of time with less volatility. In the here and now, though, they must represent a terrible investment. After all, interest rates are destined to rise, and surely dividends can't increase fast enough to keep up."
Au contraire, mon fr it sounds logical that dividend investments wouldn't be able to compete in an increasing interest rate environment, the data tells an entirely different story.
(click to enlarge)
Since 1972, dividend payers outpaced nondividend payers by almost half a percentage point per year when interest rates were increasing. So much for higher http://www.airjordanmvp.com/ rates eroding the attractiveness of dividend stocks.
What's more, during periods of stable interest rates, like we're experiencing now, dividend stocks tend to trounce their nondividendpaying counterparts. They rise an average of 12.3% per year versus 6.2% for nondividend payers according to Ned Davis Research. In other words, right now is the perfect time to invest in dividend stocks. So what are you waiting for?
Sorry. I didn't mean to Under Armour Curry One get you all excited. Especially because you need to take heed of this final myth before you rush out and load up your portfolio with dividend stocks.
Dividend Myth 3: It's All About YieldIt's been said that man cannot live on bread alone. Well, investors cannot live on yield alone. They need growth, too. So when you start looking for potential dividend investments, don't immediately flock to the highest yielders. For one thing, the high yield is often a sign of weakness, not strength.
Most of the companies that sport the highest yields do so because their stock prices have collapsed under the weight of poor Cheap Nike KD 7 For Sale fundamentals, not because management keeps increasing the dividend. Just check out Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) and Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) for proof. Most importantly, the highestyielding stocks are not the best performers. Not even close. That distinction belongs to stocks with the highest dividend growth rates.

Since 1986, stocks with the highest dividend growth rates in the S 500 Index returned far more than the highest yielders 20.5% versus 13%. So forget about chasing yield. Chase dividend growth, instead.
Bottom line: Dividend stocks might be boring. But they're not underperformers by any stretch. Not even during rising interest rate environments. So do your portfolio some good and load up on topquality dividend growers.</description>

      <description>Cell Use Ups Brain Coaci iPhone 6 Cases Activity
"Some studies have shown a significant association with cancer, others show the opposite," she said. "When you have data that is not consistent there is uncertain and uncertainty of course generates fear."
Especially considering the integral, frequent, increasing role that cell phones play in both our work and home lives. The number of mobile phone users has gone from 7.6 million in 1991 to 223 million in those older than 13 as of 2010, Hermes Apple iPhone 6 Cases according to Nielsen industry statistics.
What's more, more than half of Americans age 25 to 29 use only cell phones as a means of communication and do not live in a household that even has a landline.
It also doesn't quell fears when doctors publicly advocate for cell phone precautions. In 2008, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, along with CedarsSinai Medical Center brain surgeon Dr. Keith Black said that they use earpieces instead of holding the phone against their heads out of fear of brain tumors.
Better Safe Than Sorry Fuels Fears
Also in 2008, the director of Cancer Research at the University of Pittsburgh bolstered concerns about cell phone dangers when he released a controversial memo to his staff concerning modified cell phone practices to ward off potential harm:
"Although the evidence is still controversial, I am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use," Dr. Ronald Herberman wrote in his memo.
He went on to warn that children shouldn't use cell phones except in emergency situations because "the developing organs of a fetus or child are the most likely to be sensitive to any possible effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields."
And many other doctors take this better safe than sorry approach. Dr. Andrew Sloan, director of the Brain Tumor and NeuroOncology Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, agrees that there's no "definitive proof" that cell phones are bad. But he still advises patients to use speaker phones or ear buds when talking for prolonged periods of time because, "why take the chance?"
With doctors advising patients to "play it safe," it's hard to shake the feeling that cell phones may be unsafe.
The Significance Louis Vuitton iPhone 6 Cases of Brain Sensitivity
That researchers were able to show a consistent effect on the brain through prolonged cellphone use is "landmark," said Dr. Maciej Lesniak, director of neurosurgical oncology and
neurooncology research at the University of Chicago.
"Previous articles have tried to link cell phones to brain tumors based on large population studies, but those studies have many inherent flaws and too many variables to control," he said.
This experimental kind of research lays the groundwork for further research into exactly what's going on in the brain, whether harmful or not, when people use cell phones over long periods of time, he adds.
That said, there is little more than can be gleaned from this study beyond the fact that iPhone 6 plus cases best buy cell phones are doing something to the brain and increasing activity.
"Clearly there is an acute effect, and the important question is whether this acute effect is associated with events that MK iPhone 6 Cases may be damaging to the brain or predispose to the development of future problems such as cancer as suggested by recent epidemiological studies," Smullen said.
"Cell phones have become an essential part of our culture both for personal reasons and for work . they are here to stay, but we need to evaluate whether cell phone design and usage needs to be adjusted to avoid or minimize potential risks," she adds.</description>

      <title>Image Publishing</title>
      <description>I've imported images by a couple of different methods, Lightroom, upload, drag/drop, and all indications are that import was successful except that images all appear as spinners.  Image Publishing was using GD 2.1.0.
No other options appeared, so I installed ImageMagick 6.7.2  (CentOS, yum install).  After restarting apache, the ImageMagick option appeared for processing, so I switched and saved those settings, deleted the library content, cleared image cache, and re-published from Lightroom.  Still getting spinners.  Permissions issue on server maybe?  I did begin the install with 777 on the koken folder.  
I've got a lot of content to convert from SlideshowPro / Director so need to figure this out.
The app/logs folder is empty, so is there a way to turn on the logs?</description>

      <title>Celine Bag to wear for the bridal</title>
      <description>What to Wear to a Bridal Shower Party A bridal shower party is Celine Mini Belt Bag all about the bride; dress appropriately for the affair without overdoing your look and drawing unflattering attention. Simplicity here, is the key. 
Ah, yes. A bridal shower is a mirthful soire of sorts; the bridetobe oozes happiness from every pore, where she can't stop gushing over the fancy gifts handed to her. The best part of the Celine Mini Tie Handbag entire affair is when a team of close friends plan a raunchy night of fun of course! While all of this sounds fantastic, the hard part wondering what gift to pick out making up our minds about what to wear! Many of us dread this part, but it is commingled with excitement, no doubt. 
We advise you to steer clear from wearing a headtotoe outfit in red, black, or white, since red can take the attention away from the rosycheeked bridetobe (sorry, girls!), black unfortunately screams morbidity, and white is a strict nono because the bridetobe will ideally be clad in this immaculate color. But we've got good news for you! You can wear these colors by sneakily incorporating them into your look. We'll show you how! There's no need to pull your hair out by the handful, for you'll find a panoply of images that will give you an idea of what Celine Bag to wear for the bridal shower. 
What Outfit to Wear to a Bridal Shower Party For those Celine Phantom Cabas of you who aren't used to downplaying yo ur look at social gatherings, we insist that you don't overdo it because it'll garner unflattering comments. Don't worry, you can still be the cynosure. Just remember, this is a special day for the bridetobe before she finally ties the knot. From demure and dainty outfits, to refined and androgynous looks, we've got it all figured out for you. 
Yes, we believe that a bride should be shrouded in white, just like she will be on her wedding day. I'm sure you'll want to wear something colorful, but people need to see you from a distance and identify you as the bridetobe. It sets you apart from the rest because you ought to stand out. You don't have to wear a starkwhite dress; you can Celine Micro Tote go with eggshell, cream, or pearl white. Pair it with striking accents like a fitted black bow around the waist or a bejeweled bodice, complete with fluid, lightweight, lush fabric. 
Because you're likely to be up and about on your feet, wearing a comfortable pair of shoes is a wiser choice. But if you're like Victoria Beckham who was born with a pair of skyhigh stilettos on, then we say go for it.

      <title>Regale 2 Disable mouseover on tablets</title>
      <description>Hi,

I've noticed that the mouseover on titles keeps enabled when loading regale 2 through a tablet.  This doesn't make sense as tablets are operated as a mobile phone, by tapping and not with a mouse device.

I would like the tablet view to either render the mobile view or to show the titles fixed in some way. Can I do this through CSS? 

I understand that Koken renders desktop or mobile versions dependign on browser resolution. So if I could lift the threshold to accomodate the usual tablet resolution that would suffice too.

Thanks,
Marcos

      <title>Celine questions for you to answer on</title>
      <description>Be Successful When You Are Interviewing Virtually
You may have to start by answering several questions before qualifying for a facetoface interview. A company will come up with a series of Celine questions for you to answer on the computer when applying for the job. Depending on your answers, your final grade will either land you an interview or exclude you from moving ahead.
A potential employer may contact you via email asking you a few questions about your experience and skills. Your answers will either move you to the next step of the process or reject your application.
The most common virtual interview with a potential employer will more likely be a phone interview. The interview will generally last anywhere from 3060 minutes.
You can be successful when you are interviewing virtually!
Prepare Your http://www.celinehandbagsonline.com/ Environment
You want to find a quiet space where you will not be disturbed by any outside annoyances. If you have children, it is important to have someone watching them so you will not get interrupted during your interview. Let your family and friends know what time you will be interviewing. Ask them not to call or visit you during the specified time. You may want to put a note on the door stating "Please do not disturb: In a meeting" to avoid any distractions. Knowing as much information as possible about the company you are interviewing with is very important to shine to a potential employer. Be prepared with questions that pertain to the company. Have a list of questions that will show the interviewer you are a valuable employee. Always prepare more questions than you think you need. Many times during an interview the questions you have written down will be answered. You do not want to end an interview without Celine Bag asking a question.
Have Your Information Ready
When you are interviewed, the potential employer will ask you about your employment history. Have your resume handy so you can easily answer questions about your skill sets and employment dates. Print out the job description for which you are interviewing. Write down next to each bullet point examples of your work history that pertain to the job. You also want to have references ready upon request. Have the list of people that will give you a reference, including their phone numbers and job titles.</description>

      <title>Disable Mouseover titles for Tablets (keep enabled only for Desktop) - Regale 2</title>
      <description>Hi,

I would like disabling the mouseover function for the tiles in the albums view (http://www.marcosmontero.es/photo/ ) when this are rendered through a TABLET; so that the tiles get fixed to the image (tablets do not have mouse hence the mouseover is confusing). 

At the moment mouseover titles show for Desktop and Tablet site and not for mobile site. I'm puzzled why Regale shows the mouseover for the  tablet site since a tablet is operated the same way as a mobile phone (with no mouseover, just clicking with fingers).

Any way to do this?</description>

      <title>balenciaga bag sale above the minimum</title>
      <description>Retail jobs and fast food restaurants hire teenagers yearround. Fast food restaurants have always offered some benefits as well as pay that is balenciaga bag sale above the minimum wage set by the Federal government.
Other places to consider include retailers that can be found at most malls. Some examples include: JC Penny, Gap, Old Navy, Aeropostale, and Hot Topic. Food concessions should not be overlooked while submitting applications in a mall. WalMart is another source of employment that hires teenagers at over $9 an hour.
Knowing the required law in your state and how many hours are allowed is the first step to getting a job. The second step is to talk to the people who work there about getting an application and finding out the pay and hours offered. Dress appropriately for the job to make a good first impression, and follow up with a thank you card for the interview a day later. These are adult procedures that are not expected from teenagers and bound to keep your application on the top of the pile.
Surveys There are lots of Balenciaga Bag scams on the web that promise money for taking surveys or reviewing products, but even those that are legitimate will take up time and not pay more than $3 per survey, or reward the individual with a $10 gift card to a store. Consider doing these only in addition to a better paying proposition and always check for reviews from an independent source, such as survey police. Use resources at Teen Ink. Seek a literary agent to publish your work.
Sell Unwanted items from home or from garage sales can generate a regular source of income on Craigslist. All you need is a photo of the item, a disposable email account and a public place to meet the individual. Always go with an adult and don't give out personal information. Insist on cash only transactions.
Get certified in Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and take courses in babysitting. Teenagers charge $5 $10 an hour for babysitting and overnight jobs can yield balenciaga bag for sale even more.
Hospitals hire teenagers as greeters, and as assistants to get supplies. Contact the hospital's and clinic's human resource department and file an application. Highlight CPR certification and good social skills.

      <description>I can't see my website anymore.
Everything was working fine until this morning. It has been a long time and I wanted to make some changes on the content. 
I was prompted to update to a new version of Koken.
I clicked, the process started but the progression bar froze for a long time (more than 20 mn)
I refreshed the page and everything was gone. No admin, no front.
What happened? How to revert to what I had?

Thanks,

      <title>cheap valentino shoes the long edge </title>
      <description>Top stitch outer seam Pull the two liner pieces together and stitch along the long side. Press under valentino shoes on sale the long edge of one of the outer pieces. Flatten it so that the zipper valentino sandals is centered on the bottom seam. Stitch across both short ends. Press under cheap valentino shoes the long edge of one of the outer pieces. You're going to pull it over and stitch it to the other long edge (and to the lining). To stitch it, you'll need to open the zipper; as you get to the end, turn the piece inside out to complete the seam. The finished seam reminds me of the outside seams of blue jeans. It's a topstitch effect. 
You don't want the lining to be bigger than the outside, because it'll bunch.

      <description>How To Enhance Your Cleavage with Make Up

Makeup does a lot of wonderful things to your appearance (have you [b][url=http://www.isabelmaranton.com/]isabel marant[/url][/b] ever seen pictures of celebrities without makeup?), but did you know you could use it to enhance your cleavage as well? Here are some tips to help you enhance your cleavage with makeup:

1. Wear a cleavageenhancing bra and top. First of all, it's best that you start out with a good pushup bra. Some of the best bra brands for this purpose include Victoria's Secret, Triumph and Wonderbra. Make sure that you choose the correct size for you, for maximum effect. To find out how to correctly measure your bra size, click here. Another option that you have are padded bras, or bras that have little insertable "cookies" that add some cushion to your breast area. You should also choose a low Vneck top, as this has the effect of drawing attention to your cleavage, and making it look larger than it actually is. Thin, horizontal stripes also work to make your [b]http://www.isabelmaranton.com/ [/b] chest look more ample.

2. Prepare your makeup. You will need a mirror, a big round brush for application, bronzing powder or a face powder that's one to two shades darker than your natural color; and a face powder that's a shade lighter than your natural color. Avoid using powders that are too shimmery, as this could make your trick a little obvious. Have a trusted friend as well who could help [b][url=http://www.isabelmaranton.com/isabel-marant-sneakers-c-5.html]isabel marant sneakers online[/url][/b] you apply the makeup and tell you if your makeup's just right or a little too much.

3. Apply the makeup. It's important that you [b][url=http://www.isabelmaranton.com/isabel-marant-sandals-c-8.html]isabel marant sandals[/url][/b] apply your makeup before you wear your top, as this will help avoid you getting the makeup into your blouse (a tell tale sign!). Or, you could wear your top but protect it by putting facial tissue on the top edge.

Wearing your bra, apply the dark powder onto your natural cleavage. Make sure to blend, blend, blend! Do this by doing upward and downward strokes in the shape of the letter V. This shading technique will help make your cleavage look more pronounced than usual.

Next, apply the lighter shade of powder onto the top half of your breasts. This lighter shade will help bring the focus on towards your breasts' rounded shape, and will make it look larger. [b][url=http://www.isabelmaranton.com/isabel-marant-pumps-c-6.html]isabel marant pumps[/url][/b]

4. Remember that moderation is key. It's always better to err on the side of moderation than to make your trick look too obvious. And remember the general guideline: feel free to apply more if you're dressing up [b][url=http://www.isabelmaranton.com/isabel-marant-boots-c-7.html]isabel marant boots sale[/url][/b] for a night event, but keep it less if you're attending a daytime function.

There you have it! These are just some of the ways to enhance your cleavage with makeup. Though it's just natural to want to enhance your physical appearance, remember, it's all about confidence! Stand straight (this will also mean you'd be emphasizing your chest, which is good), wear a smile, and remember that there's nothing sexier than a woman who loves the way she looks. Good luck, and hope this helped you out!

      <title>Mulberry with a cotton blouse</title>
      <description>How to Dress in 1940s Fashion The rationing of valuable fabric marked the slim cuts of warera suits and dresses. To create the simple, utility fashion of this era, look for simple, buttonup dresses in warm colors, such as yellow, sage green and rosy pink. They should hit just above the knee and have short sleeves with slightly padded, square shoulders. Add a thin belt around your waist. Alternatively, opt for a suit with a pleated skirt and a jacket with square shoulders and a tailored waist. Pair the suit with a simple, shortsleeved blouse or knit sweater. Leave the jacket off and wear the blouse tucked into the skirt, Mulberry Bag Sale or rock a pair of pleated women pants for a casual look. 
After the war, women dress and suit cuts became much more lavish and full. Look for full skirts that reach to the calf. They should have a wide Aline shape that cinches in at the waist and billows slightly at the hem. Pair the full skirt Mulberry with a cotton blouse with soft, rounded shoulders. Tuck the blouse in and tie a colorful scarf around your waist with a playful, loose bow. Look for buttonup dresses with this same shape and sloping, soft shoulders in bright, playful patterns. Late women suits included a pencilskirt shape that hit near midcalf and tailored jackets. 
All of these beautiful outfits came with a cadre of accessories. During the war years, a simple scarf tied around the neck in a flirty bow and a simple, understated wool hat would complete a look. Search for widebrimmed straw hats, small, folded hats, and bonnetstyle wool hats. Alternatively, wear a silk scarf around your hair for a sassy, utilitarian http://www.mulberrybagsale.com/ throwback. Look for shoes with rounded toes and sturdy heels. Strappy sandals and espadrilles were popular for summertime. Add a bejeweled pin to lapels and some teardrop earrings for simple, elegant accents. 
Fabric rationing meant that the first half of the 1940s favored slimcut suits for men. Look for highwaisted suit pants with Mulberry Bags Outlet a couple of pleats at the front of each leg to give the pants some room without billowing. Look for jackets with a cut close to the frame with square shoulders and simple lapels. Leave the vest out of the equation and pair the suit with a standard dress shirt. Look for tweed, gray and navy fabrics. Top off the look with an understated fedora and a pair of black dress shoes. Add a camel trench coat for an evening out.

      <description>Hi

At my site: www.mathiasvejerslev.dk - the facebook like button at the bottom of the page suddenly has disappeared (no action on my part).. Does anyone know why, and what I can do about it? BTW, I would like to know what this button does, other than counting clicks, because unless you write a note with your like, it does not show up on facebook.

      <title>Technical problems moving Koken installation to new domain</title>
      <description>Hi

- I installed koken to new.mydomain.com/koken
- Bought a paid theme
- Then changed the Apache virtual directory from new. to www., so that the site shows at www.mydomain.com/koken
- Signed in to admin on the new site root, and the website worked okay on the new domain.

Problem is the previous domain (new.mydomain.com) still shows the theme assigned to it. The new domain doesn't show in my koken store account area, presumably because I didn't create a new Koken installation, but rather re-addressed the old one.

I could of course create a new Koken installation by renaming the virtual directory back to its previous location (new.mydomain.com) and creating a new virtual directory altogether and installing Koken to it (mydomain.com)

However I'd lose my site, and I don't fancy trying to transfer database and all site files, setting up Lightroom to republish to the new site, and dealing with the fact the image IDs will all be different!

Add to this I'm freaking out about losing my access to Koken all the time given it might be bough out...

      <title>Upload file size limit is 2MB when using fastcgi</title>
      <description>Hello,

I am using koken with fastcgi and suexec in a 2.4 Apache Server. Koken is setup and runs well.
The only problem is that no matter what I do the "Upload file size limit"  is set to 2MB.

In my Apache vhost config I have set the the Fcgi Request Length to 1GB using:
FcgidMaxRequestLen 1073741824

In the php.ini I have set the following:
post_max_size = 1024M
upload_max_filesize = 1024M
open_basedir = /vhostpath/docs/:/vhostpath/tmp/
upload_tmp_dir = /vhostpath/tmp/

Can someone give me a hint what ist missing to get a larger file upload?

Thanks for your help.

      <title>Extending Koken version check?</title>
      <description>I was thinking today, why is it that Koken only can check there own core plugins and themes for latest version?

I looked through the files, and it seams like the

handles the version check for Koken: via calls to there private GitHub.

It should be "easy" to extend that control function to also check the info.json for any custom theme/plugins:

{
   "name": "",
   "version": "",
   "description": "",
   "demo": "",
   "terms": "",
   "documentation": "",
    "author": {
      "name": "",
      "mail": "",
      "link": ""
      },
}

The "link" value is not used to day, by using this you could check for a remote info.json i.e: http://somesite.com/__koken__/info.json
And then parse it for version info.

The file could be contructed as:

{
   "themes": {
      "version": {
         "name": "Theme name",
         "version": "0.0.1"
      }
   },
   "plugins": {
      "version": {
         "name": "Plugin Name",
         "version": "0.0.1"
      }
   }
}


What do you think?
Is it possible or am I "barking" up the wrong tree here?

One other way would be to use some custom version check in the the theme itself that only get fired when admin visits the "site pane".</description>

      <title>We are the sheep</title>
      <description>Sorry to say, but it seems that we, the uses, are the fools in this game.
We are nothing but sheep, but we are kept from noticing that for quite some time until it’s getting so evident that it can’t be hidden anymore.

It’s always said, that we have to be thankful for everything that is free, but actually WE are the ones that push your ideas forward to success, by our acceptance, by our bug reports and our endless discussions (“we can’t reproduce that issue, can you provide more details…”), by spreading the word and by our enthusiasm for a piece of software that’s so promising…

At some point, actually as soon as your work got matured, you decide to implement a marketplace, which of course is great, and now we begin to love your work even more because we feel that by buying stuff, we are also buying small virtual pieces of some kind of guarantee that this thing will last for a longer time now, as a reliable basis for our own projects.

Then, some day, for one reason or another, you change your plans and decide to kick the whole thing. In favor of your families, your careers or whatever.

Sorry, i don't say thank you as a farewell.

      <description>Hello

I'm trying to move my site to a new server. The server is using HP 5.2.17, the same as the previous server. Except this is on IIS instead of Apache if that makes any difference.

I'm getting the following error:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION, expecting ')' in G:\PleskVhosts\......\koken\app\koken\Shutter\Shutter.php on line 667

The part of that file in question is:

	public static function get_email_handlers()
	{
		return array_map(function($info) {
			return array(
				'class' =&gt; $info['class'],
				'label' =&gt; $info['label']
			);
		}, array_values(self::$email_providers));
	}

Strange thing is that it was working fine in previous server.

I downloaded the version 0.19.4 of my Live System. Database copy, too. Now on this basis I wanted to start my new project. But it doesn't work! ONLY Admin-Area works fine - rest: nothing. What can i do, to get this copy to work? ;(

Or exists seperat downloads instead this live-installer? I need the last Canonical-Bug-Free-Version ;)

Thanks

      <title>two koken installations on one server</title>
      <description>Hi,

I think this questions has been asked before, but I couldn´t find an answer 100% suitable for me, so I ask again. Is it possible two have two (or more) koken installations on one server? If they were installed in different folders and databases, there shouldn´t be any issues or do the installations affect each other in any way?

I´m sorry for this kind of stupid question, I just want to be 100% save that there won`t be any problems with the already existing installation before installing another on ;)

Thanks for your help, I really love your theme, keep the good work up! ;D

Kind regards

      <title>CDN for Koken - What to include/exclude</title>
      <description>Hi,

I have just enabled CloudFare's CDN for my whole Koken domain(www.marcosmontero.es). As expected ths produced some inconsistencies while using the Admin console so I have set the following exclusion rules in CloudFare:
- *marcosmontero.es/Admin/*
- *marcosmontero.es/koken/api.asp*

I have two questions:
1. Is there anything ELSE I should exclude for the admin console to work efficiently? 
2. Do I get any benefits of using this plugin instead of putting all site under the CDN?  http://danielmuller.asia/2014/11/koken-serve-assets-through-cdn/

Thanks,
Marcos

      <title>Black Admin Screen</title>
      <description>I am getting black Admin screens on fresh installs of Koken on our host's server.  I also get them when transferring a site to the hosting server from my local machine (where the admin screen works fine).  

I am getting this error on console....min.js (line 163, col 24746):
    TypeError: this.system is null
     ...this,finished:function(e){this.system=e,this.system.apiError=!1,this.config.path...

I love the Koken system so I'd really like to get to the bottom of the "Black Admin" issue.  

Any thoughts,

      <title>Horizontal Scrolling Issues - Website Access</title>
      <description>Hello,

My website used to have a completely horizontal scrolling feature. In the past month, it now has a horizontal and vertical scrolling feature which really damages the viewing experience. The last picture on each of my project pages is situated below the text, looking out of place and half visible on the screen. I have seen this on 4 different devices (mac, windows computer, tablet and phone). Can you please explain why this has happened and help me return it to normal?

Also, it has been almost a year since I last updated my website. I have forgotten how to access the back end of my website. Can you please give me the link? Any help with these issues would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks</description>

      <title>Back button, content not showing</title>
      <description>Trying again because the other topic never got a single reply with the exception of my own...

My problem seems to be similar to this:
http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/9894897-back-button-problem-of-madison2
and this:
http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/9660426-madison-2-problem-displaying-pages

Unfortunately the bug doesn't seem to have been fixed.

Basically, when clicking the back button (or returning to a previously displayed picture via the site navigation), the image doesn't load anymore, rendering just a white page. Please note that the menu stays in place. 

Reloading the page via the browser's button makes it work again, until the back button is clicked. Once this behaviour is triggered, no part of the site works anymore (clicking on a different page such as essays or static pages shows nothing, either).

Emptying the images/system cache and the api cache via FTP doesn't solve the issue. Also, template cache is uncheked.

Upon checkign the console, the following message is reported:
TypeError: this.next.css is not a function
in jquery.pjax-transition.js

The problem doesn't seem to be consistent, somehow I think it relies on the speed at which the page is loaded. On slow connections it occurs less frequently than on fast ones.

Any tips welcome.</description>

      <title>Seeking Koken performace optimisation advice (Hosted in Dreamhost shared Hosting)</title>
      <description>Hi,

I am hosting Koken on Dreamhost shared hosting and I'm not entirely happy with the performance I'm getting out of it. Page loads on the home page go from 1.5 sec to 4sec and overall it feels much slower compared to other Koken sites using the same template (Regale 2). It can be a subjective topic but to me it feels too slow for what I would think a portfolio should render.  The lightbox view is barely usable because it takes 2sec to load a cached image of 1200 px of length.

I'm conscious there are number of things I can do in this front, and I have already tried some things (reducing quality of caches, contacting DH support etc, moving from a 2 column to a 3 colum grid etc). All my source files are 2048 lenght JPGs and imported through the LR plugin.  

I would like to ask if someone could kindly have a look at my site (www.marcosmontero.es) and tell me what sort of things I can do to improve speed? 

One of the things I'm considering is upgrading from shared hosting to a VPS but DH support (and per articles) do not assure that would make things faster on page loading. I would give it a try and compare but if I upgrade to VPS I lose my 60-day Dreamhost money-back guarantee that is only available for shared hosting.

Also,  I'm based in the UK so I wonder my issues are lag related? If so, could anyone recommend a UK/EU hosting provider?

Thanks,
Marcos

      <title>updates?</title>
      <description>The last update for koken was released on March 25, 2015. Since then nothing, nada. Before that there were several updates every month! Is there a chance that koken will be developped and updated again in the near future?

      <description>Hello!

At first I would like to thank you so much for your great work!!!

My first question: When I started to put some pictures into the token-site, I somehow deleted the blog. Can I get it back?

second question: Is it possible to reset the whole theme? I would like to start again putting only new pictures and text into the site. But without changing my theme settings. Is that possible?

Thanks in advance

      <description>I am giving Koken a try on a local installation on Wamp. 

Installation goes well until the file download step and stops at: "Fetching the latest version of Koken".

I have checked the directory and can see that some files have been uploaded: 
- pclzip.lib.php

Are there other files in the package?

      <title>Album in Set is only visible in draft, but not in live website. How to publish?</title>
      <description>Hi,
I currently see a strange behavior: I created a new Album and added some images. The album and the images are public. The album appears in the public timeline page, visitors can see and open the album and browse the images. 

Then I added the album to an existing set. When I open the set in the pubic website, the album is not there. When I go to Admin =&gt; Site =&gt; Draft mode, the album is there, when I switch to live mode, the album is gone.

What is the "magic" here to make the album public inside the set? Are there any caches in effect? I restarted Apache+PHP+Memcached, but that didn't help.

Any advice appreciated.

Thanks

      <title>Blocking loopback connections</title>
      <description>Solved my earlier issue.  Now I have a new one which arose as soon as I tried to change settings. 

Started with never-ending saving.

Now I cannot access my site.  The error message says I need to ask my host to unblock loopback connections.

They say unfortunately they cannotdo this as I am on shared hosting and I would need an expensive vetual private server  to unblock loopback connections.  Is there any way to use Koken without getting a VPS?

      <description>Hi!

First: Great Software! I like it and I want to give it a try. 

By my mistake I installed the koken software with the wrong subdomain. Now my installation is reachable by admin.tj-foto.de/koken. I would like to change to www.tj-foto.de. By the webhosting portal I linked www.tj-foto.de to /koken but it doesn't work. 

Any ideas? Or is a new installation requirred?

      <description>Hey,

Great system first off. I've started having a bit of a weird issue with Chrome. The problem I have is the last image in any set is creating a duplicate row for itself at the beginning of the of the set page. It is also doing it on chrome android, but not firefox for some reason. If you could offer any suggestions I would be much obliged - have recommended koken to a good few colleagues who all love it too - I'm a amazed you aren't charging and would be willing to pay an annual fee for support if needs be.

Safe and much love,

Ed

I am not at all familiar with koken so I need advice. Is it possible to have only three projects visible as seen currently here (http://heroconceptart.com/). I would like the other projects to fade in and replacing the ones on the page. Currently adding new projects tiles them all and reduces their size on the homepage. Is there a some way that this can be done?
