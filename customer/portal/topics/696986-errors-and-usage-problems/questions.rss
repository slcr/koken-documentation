      <title>Thumbnails distorted/deformated</title>
      <description>Hello everyone! I have a problem on my site with thumbnails generation - images became distorted/deformated. I don't know how to describe it...it would be better to see live example here:  http://annadianova.com/koken/storage/cache/images/000/772/IMG-8,medium.1441821992.jpg
It started to happen after I had changed my hosting provider.
I've tried to change image processing between Imagick 6.9.0-3, ImageMagick 6.9.0 and GD bundled (2.1.0 compatible), but that didn't help the situation. I also switched php version from 5.5 to 5.3.
Some information about my server:
PHP Version 5.3.29
MySQL Version 5.6.25-73.1-beget-log
Server operating system Linux
Webserver software Apache/2.4.10-1-beget-reuseport (Unix)
Image processing GD bundled (2.1.0 compatible)
FFmpeg Installed (Version 2.6.3)
Memory limit 256MB
Upload file size limit 999MB
EXIF/IPTC parsing Supported
I don't know what to do next, please help my</description>

      <title>Chrome thinks site is in Sudanese</title>
      <description>Every once in a while when I load my site in Chrome, it detects that the page is in Sudanese and asks me if I want to translate it. Is there some setting I need to change somewhere?</description>

      <title>Koken Store access via CMS</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I have set up Koken via my hosting company on my server yesterday. I also bought the "Regale2" theme via the koken website. However, when I try to log on to the Store through the admin area, I receive an error message. " Unauthorized access -  Your request has been sent. You will be notified via email if accepted.  - Sign Out"

I would like to access the store to install the purchased theme and other plugins.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

      <title>Noting is working properly</title>
      <description>Hi,

I'm having a lot of problems all of a sudden with Koken.
No matter what I do, feature a photo, un-feature a photo, remove a photo from an album or add a photo to an album, it just doesn't work.

I always get a message saying it succesfully did those thing but when I look in the folders, nothing changed.

I got this problem out of nowhere, after not using Koken for over a month... 

Please help because my site became unmanageable...</description>

      <title>Uploading images, no thumbnails, just spinning</title>
      <description>When uploading images, there is no thumbnail generated. Just a spinning image. I've tried numerous solutions found on your forum (resetting, empty cache, changed image processing, modified .htaccess, even tried chmod 777 (just briefly) and a lot more...), none solved the problem. I might have missed something though... That's why I'm asking for your assistance.

I was really hoping to use this CMS, because it's totally awesome. I even considered spending som cash in your store. But as long as the most basic uploading does not work, I'm not so sure.

I have the currently latest version of Koken installed on a droplet at Digital Ocean, I'm using Debian 7, GD and Imagemagick installed. I'm using a subfolder on my domain name, just for testing yet. But it's accessible for you if needed.</description>

      <title>Console Error while accessing the Site tab</title>
      <description>Firstly I'd like to say thank you to anyone who takes the time to look over this. I really appreciate it! 

Every time I try to access the site tab, I get the following error popup: 


"Console error

Koken isn't able to load data. Please click the button below to try and fix the problem. If you see this error message again thereafter, please contact us for support." 


The button says "clear cache and reload." It doesn't do anything except freeze the site when I click it, so I've tried clearing the caches though the Settings tab (template, image and system where the ones I could find to clear), with no result. 

Other info: when this error first showed up, I was discarding an unwanted theme draft in the Site tab. My Site tab now always directs me to "http://mysite.com/koken/admin/#/site/draft/theme/url:/". 

Thanks again for looking into this! </description>

      <title>Images Go Away Upon Return to Site, Have to Shift-Reload to Get Them Back</title>
      <description>Hello,

This problem has existed for a while I think, I was wondering if anyone had a solution. I've had potential clients report this and it's a real problem. For ones that told me about the issue who knows how many just left. I tried the updated jquery.pjax-transition.js file but it didn't seem to make any difference.

The basic problem is you go to the site and it works fine, great. You go to some other sites and then return. No  images, just the header and footer and no images. Hitting refresh doesn't do it. Shift-reload will bring the images back, but you shouldn't have to do that and a lot of users won't or don't know about shift-reload.

Any solutions?

Thanks,
Milton

      <title>Error 500 'failed to load resource'</title>
      <description>My customised index.lens renders as blank page, with an error 500 'failed to load resource' in the Safari Web Inspector.  Annoyingly, there is no further detail in the Inspector log - is there any way to see what's going wrong from the koken side of things?  I appreciate you guys are trying to sell off Koken, and might not be too keen to engage in extensive support / fixing errors.  But if you want to keep the source code to yourself - that rather puts you on the spot for providing support.</description>

      <title>Canonical URLs</title>
      <description>I have ver. 20.4. According to docs,

"Koken automatically publishes canonical meta tags in the  of any page that needs one. For example:  This is handled for you automatically, so there's nothing you need to edit or modify."

For me, page link is showing as http://natureinfocus.com/albums/birds/content/burrowing-owl/ in browser. Canonical link in the source code shows 


I was trying to generate sitemap and am getting a circular reference:
http://natureinfocus.com/albums/birds/content/burrowing-owl/ to http://natureinfocus.com/index.php?/albums/birds/content/burrowing-owl/" which is a 302 error and then back to
http://natureinfocus.com/albums/birds/content/burrowing-owl/

Any way to fix this? Seems similar problem as reported at http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/11637446-canonical-url-don-t-work-tag-content-page-

Can anyone help fix this?

Forgot my admin-PW and used the reset-Script. It shows up a new password but no e-Mail. If I use my Admin-eMail (yes it is the right one :-) ) and the new password nothing happens. Koken tells my that the PW is incorrect.

NEED HELP! PLease :-) Thank you.</description>

      <title>404 error at admin login page</title>
      <description>I successfully installed the php.index file to my DreamHost server using a notebook. (I should state that said notebook is my cousin's, and was done at her house) I also successfully logged in to the admin page while there and started creating my website, which is douglasrbain.com 

Now that I've gotten home, I can absolutely see the content that is on the website, but can not even get to a login UI at http://douglasrbain.com/koken/admin  All that yields is my website with an additional "Error 404" on it. 

I'm a bit perplexed by this behavior. I thought that once it was installed, it wouldn't matter what computer I was using to log in to the admin panel?

Thanks,

Are you aware of this/Is this a common problem?

Gives me a rather dissapointing "This article doesn't have a translation for English"
This happens with all of the help articles I need to read.

Is there a system wide error in your support articles?

I love the CMS you guys have created it is top notch :)

      <title>photo's are in the wrong place</title>
      <description>Hi Koken-team!

Thank you for letting me use the amazing software for my website.

I have installed theme ‘Boulevard’ for my photography website: www.emmawesters.nl. And for the most part it works fine. Within that theme, you have one horizontal line with pictures. But when I am looking at my website on a mobile device or on some computers, I see the last picture from the album underneath the horizontal line with pictures. So there are almost two lines with pictures. How can I get rid of the second line with pictures? Could you please help me? 

Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards, Emma W.

      <title>Theme API Error</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I'm using Koken for almost over a year now with a lot of enjoyment. But yesterday evening my website stopped working and gave me this error:

 "API ERROR: The theme is not able to make contact with your Koken installation. Contact your host to see if they are blocking loopback connections".

I've contacted my hosting company and they've told me that loopback connections are enabled. So what's the problem? I've searched the Koken forum without any luck. 

My website is: http://www.reinkooyman.com/

Thanks in advance!

With kind regards,

      <title>404 error when accessing all thumbnails or images via admin and website view</title>
      <description>Hello,
I believe I am experiencing issues similar to this post which was never solved:
http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/11634152-photos-don-t-load-in-library-spinner-only-requests-to-i-php-return-4-4-

Koken tests the server on install and gives the green light, but after a successful installation, photos upload successfully, but never display.  Whether in the admin or via the website view itself, all photos just result in a spinner running forever and the corresponding request for each photo ends in a 404 after about 5 - 10 seconds of waiting for a response.

Server memory limit is 128MB and I'm testing with a very small image ~200KB

I've noticed that some Koken admins have offered to login to other systems to try and debug issues, I'd be happy to supply credentials to my site to have someone take a look.

Thanks very much,

      <title>api cache</title>
      <description>Another question mentioned this but I cannot add to it. 

Is it safe to delete the contents of the /storage/cache/api folder as it is ballooning to over 600Mb.
Clear system caches and clear images cache controls from the main admin panel do not seem to touch it.

      <title>Image Quality Problem</title>
      <description>Hi Folks,

recently I installed the latest version (0.21.2) of koken for a new project. After uploading the first pictures I recognized a massive quality problem. Dark color gradients in images are getting blocky and blurred. Just like too much compression is applied. In an other installation (version 0.20.5) on the same server I do not experience this.

Settings are default and identical on both installations. Library is ImageMagick 6.2.8 on PHP 5.5.25.

Here are crops showing the problem:
http://bay3r.de/koken20.5.jpg
http://bay3r.de/koken21.2.jpg

Any ideas how to solve this? Btw. selecting custom values in "Image Publishing" makes no difference at all.

Thanks and cheers</description>

      <title>Regale 2 not updating og:title when changing page name</title>
      <description>I know this might be minor, but when changing a page name (like for e.g. changing Albums to "Collection"), the Open Graph name isn't changed along with it, meaning that when the page is shared to for e.g. Facebook, the link will state "Albums", when the page isn't called that anymore.

Would be fantastic if this could be updated :)</description>

      <title>Timeline not displaying new items correctly</title>
      <description>Hi, I'm using Axis 2 and have the following issue with Timeline:
When posting a new image into any album it shows up in timeline as "1 new item". So far so good. However, when I later publish the next image to the same album this also shows up as "1 new item", like it should, but the previous image still has the "1 new item" tag. Should not this tag be automatically removed whenever a newer image is put into the same album? After a while, with several additions to the album, they all appear as new items, which does not seem very logical to me. Any views on this? Anything I might do to prevent this?</description>

      <description>I'm seeing a lot of problems in regards to cache for my images. Often I go into one of my albums, and I see in the console for e.g: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

GET my-host/storage/cache/images/000/359/IMG-7676,medium.2x.1437049360.jpg 404 (Not Found)

And then the thumbnail image just spins. I login to the site, and I see that yes, that cache-image doesn't exist. But why doesn't it simply create it? Where is it stored that there should be a cached version that it's trying to load?

This also often happens that thumbnails load on my retina-screen, but then I see the cache problem when looking at the album on a non-retina computer etc.

I've tried clearing the cache, but it's still the same issue sadly.

What can I do to increase the reliance on the cache in this instance? It's really hurting my site when this happens :(</description>

      <title>Images come out stripy</title>
      <description>Hi, 

i'm noticing that my images are coming out like the one underneath.
http://anderstalleraas.com/koken/storage/cache/images/000/276/031152800002-3,medium_large.1436799488.jpg

It's mostly noticeable on images with a pure white (255) background, but I think it´s precent in other images too, although more subtle.

is this a known issue?

      <title>bug</title>
      <description>Good afternoon.Recently I started to use your system for the site. Really liked the theme of "Ensemble". But the pattern has a very serious bug.
Manifested it is this. If you open an album and a little run through the button "arrow at the bottom" and then click "arrow at the top", it is redirected to the page with the albums. If you can fix yourself.

      <title>HTTP Errors uploading photos (worked before)</title>
      <description>Hello,

I write because I started to use Koken yesterday to set up my personal photography portfolio. I first uploaded a single photo to test it out, and it worked. Then I drag-and-dropped about 120 photos, and only 91 did upload, the others failing with "HTTP Error" displayed.

The domain name is http://www.justahype.net/photography

I did some research about the error and it seems like it is likely to be a hosting limitation issue. I have a domain name and hosting with OVH. I have checked on my OVH dashboard, and I am far from the storage limit (2.86/25.00GB), and the stats show peaks of HTTP requests on my website at the times I uploaded, but none of these are above the host limits.

The only option left is PHP limits, but since I managed to upload more than 90 photos, I don't understand why the remaining can't be uploaded (they are the same size or smaller).

Please let me know what is the issue, and what I can to to fix it. Thank you in advance for your reply.

      <title>Problem with tags</title>
      <description>Hello, I really start loving koken and I hope it will live for a long time, even if times are kind of rough.

Now my problem....

I would love to use categories and tags on all images. Categories work fine, but the tag thing doesn't.
 When I add a tag (in this case mobil) to an image it comes out as 
,mobil, 
and the link looks like this 
.../koken/tags/%2Cmobil%2C/inhalte/ 
and the result is a 404 page.

I use the madison 2 theme, but I tried it with different themes.

Is there anything I did wrong?

      <description>Hi, 

I'm suddenly experiencing some strange problems with my site (life.timhartl.de).
All of a sudden I'm not able to login anymore. I worked on the site, switched browser and then I couldn't login anymore. Reset password tells me, that my e-mail isn't found in the system. The e-mail is definitely correct, I even checked it in the database. I've already seen several people now experiencing this kind of issues the last days. No one got an answer yet. So please help us!</description>

      <title>SEO Problem</title>
      <description>Hi, I moved from an other CMS to Koken for about a year, and I'm really happy with it for a lot of reasons. However, I have an important problem since I made the change: my website moved from top result on google with a search of my First Name Last Name to the 4th page! 

Thus, I'm invisible on the net... Do you have some advices to solve this problem? Of course, I already have set some Description and Keywords in the "Site publishing" section of the settings tab. Obviously I'm thinkin of getting back a concurrent CMS even if Koken seems much more comfortable to use for me...

My website: www.sebastienbouvier.com

      <title>Strange thing about moving albums</title>
      <description>Hi

First of all, I am using koken for a while now and I really like it.

I have a strange problem with moving albums from one set to another set. If I select an album in the right part and move it to another set, then the one left and rigt is also moved.

When I count the albums in a set in the left part and compare it in the middle part, then the numbers dont match.

See example: Number in Projects = 14; number in the middle =16 -&gt; Difference  = 2 albums

Does anybody whats wrong. Thank you very much for your help.

      <title>Unable to change URL</title>
      <description>I've been having some issues with my koken dashboard for a couple weeks now and havent been able to get a response from support so I'm hoping to get some help here. Thanks in advance to anyone who has advice!!

Current issue:
After some trouble with my koken site (more details below), I'm trying to switch out my old site with a new one. However, I don't seem to be able to update the url for a new koken site to my "live" url (sarahrittenour.com). When I try to update the url on a new koken account, I see an error message that simply says "true" and then continues to say "saving" without actually saving. Once I get the "true" error, the site is blank and I get an error message when trying to login to the dashboard that says "Connection Error - Cannot connect to API" on both koken sites that I've created. The old site is still semi-functional so I'd like to keep it as a back up but even if I change the url, move the files, or completely delete the old site files from the server, I still get that "true" error. I'm completely stuck at this point.

Background:
I was rearranging some albums in the koken dashboard for my "old" site and the dashboard seemed to freeze while I was moving an album. I hit refresh and it looks like all of my public albums are gone. The live site is suddenly missing photos so I go through my hosting provider and restore a backup of the site which is now semi-functional but still missing half of my albums. I'm unable to create any new albums or make any changes to existing albums on the site and the public albums still don't appear in the dashboard.

If anyone can help me figure out how to resolve the issues on the existing site or change the url for a new site without getting that "true" error, I'd be very very appreciative.
Thanks!!</description>

      <title>Can't connect to store from Koken install</title>
      <description>Version 0.21.2
Safari 6.2.7
Template: Repertoire 1.5.2

Store link in the Admin area returns me to the Content screen.

Template issues:
EXIF data does not display, cannot turn EXIF display off.
IPTC data does not show
"Captured" field in site view (collection) remains at published date instead of creation date despite changing settings in Collection and Import. Cleared both system and image cache.

This is basic functionality offered by the template, but it appears broken.

Can you advise what is wrong?

      <title>Future of Koken?</title>
      <description>I have just discovered Koken a couple of weeks ago, and LOVE it. Its ease of use and simple beauty. I have also just realised, that it seems to be dying a slow death, and it would be horrible if that happened! I have read the threads about two of the three team members leaving and all that, but I would love to get a clear statement about the future of Koken from the guy(s) behind.
If it is to drift toward its doom, would it be impossible to make it open source instead?
If Koken does indeed have a future, I could see myself spending a ton of money in here, but as yet I am holding back, because the future of the system is unclear.
Does Koken have a future?</description>

      <description>Hi,

I'd like to install a theme I purchased a while back however when I try to open the store in koken it tells me I need to install the new version and then I get this message?

Koken encountered a problem while updating and reverted back to the previous version to ensure your site continues to work. Please try the update again. If you continue to have issues, please contact Koken support.

Any way to fix this? Get access to the store?</description>

      <title>Latest koken - pulse not loading items</title>
      <description>Dear Koken Dev,

I used Lauren's pulse strip code as a basis for my galleries a while back:

https://gist.github.com/laurendavissmith/5568811

Everything was working fine until I updated my koken installation.

Almost everything works:
- clicking on the image in the slideshow
- using left and right arrow keys 
- etc

However, when I click on the thumbnails, I it will not load the actual image.

Here's a page you can see it failing at:

http://www.farhezrayani.com/portfolio/albums/landscape

I've tried deleting the caches etc.

Any advice appreciated.

      <title>Splash slideshow issues</title>
      <description>My splash of featured content, when using the latest regale theme, isn't working.

When I resize the browser window, the image is shrinking to fit without being cropped. I want my image on the splash to fill the height and width, no matter what ratio I've scaled my browser window to.

I've tried all the available options and think there's a problem.

Is this a known issue? It was working fine until recently.

Thanks,

      <title>Navigation floats with scroll / Safari only</title>
      <description>Hello,
i have a problem with the koken theme boulevard. It works fine with browsers like chrome, i exp. &amp; safari 
in desktop mode, but the navigation with break when switching to a mobile view. The Bug occurs on IOS devices with a smaller width than ...700px... The navigation will float free with the scrolling of the album. This 
problem affects all sorts of templates. 
Does someone know this issue or has a solution for this bug? I would greatly appreciate your help here.
Thanks a lot in advance.

Best regards

      <title>Problem with RHEL/CentOS 7</title>
      <description>This is the second time that I've tried installing Koken on a CentOS 7 VM.  It always says:

Your server does not meet the minimum system requirements.
Correct the problems listed below then try again.

This directory does not have the necessary permissions to perform the install. Set the permissions on the koken folder and the koken/index.php file to 777.

However, it does have the correct permissions.

[root@localhost noselfies.net]# ls -l
total 0
drwxrwxrwx. 3 root root 31 Jun 22 23:46 public_html

[root@localhost public_html]# ls -l
total 48
-rwxrwxrwt.  1 root root 39395 Feb 16 13:40 index.php
drwxrwxrwx. 10 root root  4096 Jun 22 23:43 ms

In both the file and the directory it is in, there are chmod -R 777 permissions. Any suggestions.  FYI, the install works fine in CentOS 6 and Ubuntu.

      <title>Private w/password Gallery Navigation</title>
      <description>Is it possible to navigate freely within a private image gallery? 

I'll give an example of how I have one of my galleries set up, and the issue I'm having with it. It's as follows:

I create a set, let's call it "Casting" and within the "casting" set I create 2 more set's, called: "Group 1" and "Group 2". Within these each of these sets I have 5 albums of images. 

I take the password protected link I have that brings me to the main "Casting" set. From this main "Casting" set I am able to navigate anywhere I please - so long as that is forward. By the time I get to one of my albums deep within this hierarchy it is impossible to navigate to one of the above folders. I would be forced to backspace page by page, which seems a bit ridiculous.

Ideally, I would be viewing an image and could then click a link at the top of the page that brought me back to the album, and then from the album into the containing group folder, and from the group folder into the "Casting" set. 

As far as I can tell, there is zero navigation possible. There are the " Home / Sets / "Casting"" but when I click home or set they take me to nothing, because everything is private. 

Any help/ideas?

      <description>Whenever I delete sets of images from my koken site they are wiped from the interface, but the amount of disk space on my server remains unchanged. Essentially, nothing is happening at all except not being able to access them anymore. 

Am I missing something here?

I am putting things in the trash and emptying the trash. As far as I can tell Koken thinks they're gone.

      <title>.htaccess passwords don't work anymore - and need backup/retrieve images from database</title>
      <description>hi,
I ran into a problem last week. Can't run a koken-only website because I need an ordering system for my clients (I use Fotoplayer which is written in flash). I use a custom link in the menu to this webpage. This page has to be password protected. I've always done this with .htaccess. Works great. But not in combination with KOKEN because KOKEN's htaccess somehow messes things up. I get a "404 not found" page when I click on the custom link to the page with the Fotoplayer webgallery. There's no syntax error in the hyperlink. I've double checked it! I emailed KOKEN about this but get no answer (I'm in a hurry, clients are waiting) so I'll post it here, hope someone can help. In the meanwhile I use my old website again and the KOKEN website (in subdir /KOKEN) through menubutton "new website". In the old website the webgallery works fine (the .htaccess works too). I had to delete the .htaccess files that KOKEN makes also to have the old index.htm work even if it's in the root and KOKEN is in it's own dir. 

Other question: is there a quick way to download all the originals from my website? In Slideshow Director this was pretty easy, but I can't find them here, there obviously in the sql database, but how on earth can I get them out? Really need help with this. 
thanks a lot

I took the /koken off the end of the URL in the settings and clicked save, it got stuck with the saving icon, and now I can't see the web page I have been building NOR can I even get into the admin page - message on the admin page reads Connection Error - Cannot connect to API. 

Has anyone had this problem and fixed it? Any help very much appreciated.

      <description>Hi Guys,

I've been getting the infamous http error on certain images i upload. And its somehow been getting worse. 
The requirements are met. I have enough space left, enough memory, the correct image processing library and sufficient permissions.  The tmp folder is empty. The max upload limit is more than enough. And as I said some images work, some dont. Cant relate it to a file type.

I've also contacted koken directly with the domain, username and pw but no answer from them, so now i'm trying here.

Thanks.

      <title>Lightbox Load Issue</title>
      <description>Hi 

Having an issue where the light box fires but then the content doesn't load. Getting the following error several times when i inspect the console. 

Thought initially it was an issue with cashing but wiped the cache and that didn't solve it then i realized the light box link is creating a url that doesn't sit with what I'm used to seeing 
 
&gt;&gt; Instead of generating .... albums/quiz-show/content/quiz-show-00/lightbox/ 
&gt;&gt; It's generating ... albums/quiz-show/content/quiz-show-00/lightbox/lightbox/?base_folder=/

If you remove the [lightbox/?base_folder=/] everything works fine again. 

Any idea how to get round this. I'm all up to date. Can recreate the problem here. http://www.andrewdedwards.co.uk/albums/categories/theatre/quiz-show/ just hit the lightbox button. 

Thanks in advance for any help. </description>

      <title>Some albums not shown on category-page</title>
      <description>We're trying to use the category-page to display all albums and essays related to each category. For reasons we don't understand, certain albums are not displayed on the category overview pages. These albums are correctly displayed on all other pages, however.

Example:
On this page, all albums in the "chile"-category are displayed correctly: https://onewayticket.hagemann.me/country/chile/albums/

On the following page, the "Torres del Paine" album is missing: https://onewayticket.hagemann.me/country/chile/

(We renamed "categories" to "country", hence the different URLs.)

Can anybody tell us the reason for this? We couldn't find any difference in the albums themselves.

Thanks for any help!

      <description>I published my website yesterday and no images are showing up. It looks like that the website is still loading but my images doesn't appear. Even in the admin tool for editing the website, the images doesn't show up. I have used the elementary theme. I have cleared the cache and was expecting that this will build up automtically by koken.
Does anyone experience the same issue? Thank you in advance for your help.</description>

      <title>I locked myself out of Koken, apparently</title>
      <description>I installed Koken as the photo blog on my site, and all worked great - until yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not able to log in to the admin interface. My password doesn't work, the reset email never gets sent out, and the password-reset.php generates a password (but leaves the email field empty), but it doesn't work either.

Any ideas what can I do now? I have thousands of photos uploaded and many of them already categorized and tagged - I'd HATE to start over.

Help appreciated!</description>

      <title>Empty content upon clicking back button</title>
      <description>Hello,
I have exactly the same problem as described in this post:
http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/9894897-back-button-problem-of-madison2

Reloading the page makes it work again, until the back button is clicked (both the browser button and the back button within image navigation cause the problem). Once this behaviour is triggered, no part of the site works anymore (clicking on a different page such as essays or static pages shows nothing, either) until the page is reloaded.

Emptying the images/system cache and the api cache via FTP doesn't solve the issue. Also, template cache is uncheked.

      <title>No longer can sign in</title>
      <description>I was wondering if there is a way to restore my login email. I recently changed a bunch of the email addresses in the settings to try to force the contact emails to go to another email address and now I can no longer get signed in to the admin section. It tells me my original and new email address are not found when I try to reset the password. The password reset script wouldn't work for either.</description>

      <title>Store Tab Problem</title>
      <description>Hi,

First thanks for Koken, although I'm very new (just installed) it looks and feels awesome and I can't wait to learn to use it. 

My problem is that when I click on the [Store] tab it tries to go to the store page but returns to [Content] tab about a second afterwards. I'd like to use the store for themes and plugins. Can they be installed separately?

Any help appreciated.

Best Regards

Mel
