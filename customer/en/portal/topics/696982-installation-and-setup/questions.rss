      <title>Directory structure, storage setup</title>
      <description>Hey there, I am trying to setup koken in a way that it stores all images on non system drive. (using aws ec2 amz linux ami) Idea is to keep small fast storage for system and keep all my data on extra attached storage. 
Can you please provide some guidance on directory structure? I would setup symlinks then for main storage folders. 

Cheers, </description>

      <title>[pool www] server reached pm.max_children setting (5), consider raising it</title>
      <description>Hi,

I keep getting this error in my php7.0-fpm.log file:
[pool www] server reached pm.max_children setting (5), consider raising it.

I'm hosted on Digital Ocean with a 1GB / 1 CPU droplet running with Ubuntu 16.04 with php 7.0-fpm and Nginx 1.10.3 with MariaDB 10.0.29.

The www.conf has the default settings of:
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 5
pm.start_servers = 2
pm.min_spare_servers = 1
pm.max_spare_servers = 3
;pm.max_requests = 500

I've tried changing the settings, by increasing the numbers, which makes the problem worse with MariaDB constantly crashing.

This is the main server block configuration I have at the moment:

Any help with this would be great as this has been going on for many months now and would like to see this resolved.</description>

      <title>Cannot open store from application</title>
      <description>Hi,

the header link "store(1)" shows there is an update in the store. 
I can open store via browser and login.
I cannot open the store in koken using the header link "store". the store appears as white area (without any content, but player buttons above) for 1 to 2 seconds and falls back into the library view.

Could you give me any hints?

Thank you very much!</description>

Copy the following JavaScript and paste it as close to the opening  tag as possible on every page of your website, replacing GTM-XXXX with your container ID:

(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],

})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXX');

Copy the following snippet and paste it immediately after the opening  tag on every page of your website, replacing GTM-XXXX with your container ID:

      <description>Hey there :)

I'm using koken for quite a time now. 
I'm starting with a new business which requires that I have a website in differetn languages. I'm a noob in html and stuff, is there any way that I could create a second website and implement a button with which the user could at any time switch the language?

Thanks a lot!

      <description>Hi,

i forgot to enter my correct email last time. so, our website is: geckogear.com.au and the hosting server is windows based.
My question is if we install Koken into out server will the final URL link to our own website something like www.images.geckogear.com.au?

      <title>database</title>
      <description>I am using koken on a new Drobo 5n2 - I have installed koken and I can see my online portal where my images should be, etc.  It says to add images, just drag and drop them.  
I don't want to do that.  Is there any way to point the koken database to a folder of images that is already on my Drobo?</description>

      <title>Install Ensemble</title>
      <description>Hi! I have installed koken on my database, and I registered. I created a shop.koken account, and I am signed in. Now, as I'm trying to download Ensemble I keep getting this error message: "Installation of this product requires an account with a registered installation of Koken. If you have an account, please sign-in. If you don't, create one here."
I've tried to sign out and sign in again. 
I deleted the token file from my database and installed it again by adding "koken1_" on the admin setup screen.
Nothing has helped.
How should I proceed?</description>

      <title>Use existing photo directory</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I've installed Koken as an addon to my Netgear ReadyNAS 314.  It already contains my photos from the last few years in a single directory that itself has a sub-directory for each album.  How do I point Koken to the existing photos?

Ideally Koken would: 
  - leave the photo files untouched
  - not waste disk space by duplicating the photos  
  - add uploaded images to the existing directory structure

Can it work this way?

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Karl.</description>

      <title>installation </title>
      <description>I seem to be failing at the first step!  I'm installing to a vps with php7 and lighttpd under ubuntu 16.04.  The web server runs fine, and I can access web pages I put up there.  I created a mysql database.  I downloaded the koken installation script .. unzipped it and placed the /koken folder in the root domain (happens to be at /var/www/html).

When I access the url http://yourdomain.com/koken (of course, putting my own domain in there), I get a "403 - Forbidden".   I tried moving the index.php out of the /koken directory, put a few random files in there, and my browser when going to yourdomain.com/koken shows the directory contents.  So its not the browser not accessing the directory, but seemingly something about the index.php which causes the 403 message.

I've googled, but not found anyone else with the problem.  The lighttpd error log has nothing to show.

Any suggestions?</description>

after this Instruction:
https://docs.plesk.com/en-US/onyx/administrator-guide/plesk-administration/using-docker.75823

when connecting to my domain (https) i get the set up screen, i'm able to set admin, email and password. clicking next until i got the login screen. it will not take the right credentials, now matter what, on clicking reset password  and entering the email nothing happens. aber opening a tab with the site on the homepage i get: "API Error

The theme is not able to make contact with your Koken installation. Contact your host to see if they are blocking loopback connections." what does that mean specifically?

is there anything that is needed to be done to fix this, or do you have a tutorial for plesk?

      <title>Download link for images in album view</title>
      <description>Hello Koken Team

I would like to have the possibility (in my custom theme) to create download link (icons) for each image in the album view. But the lens tag "koken:max_download" and the koken:if check for "settings.content_show_dl" isn't working in the album context.

I know from the documentation that max_download is only available in the content template and not within the album image loop. Is there any workaround?

greetings

      <title>Koken installation on DigitalOcean Ubuntu Docker 17.04.0-ce on 16.04</title>
      <description>Followed the DigitalOcean installation guide, modified the hosts file and added the loopback rule to firewall. Installation still hangs and getting the regular loopback error...What to do?</description>

      <title>API Error with SSL reverse proxy and koken  0.22.20</title>
      <description>I have a koken setup with two servers:

Koken [ip: 10.107.29.182]: HTTP installation with nginx and php-fpm on port 80
Frontend [ip: 10.107.29.61]: SSL proxy that forwards connection to koken and which does SSL termination and which is available on the internet.

With this setup I'm getting Koken API Error: " The theme is not able to make contact with your Koken installation. Contact your host to see if they are blocking loopback connections. "

When looking at the logs I see that koken is able to connect to the server:
10.107.29.182 - - [06/May/2017:11:12:10 +0000] "\x16\x03\x01\x02\x00\x01\x00\x01\xFC\x03\x03;(\xD1\xC02Al\x1C\xF9\x1C\xAA\xFE\xDE\x95\xAE\x09\xBA&lt;               curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, 'http' . '://' . $host . self::$location['real_root_folder'] . '/api.php?' . $url);
---
&gt;               curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, self::$protocol . '://' . $host . self::$location['real_root_folder'] . '/api.php?' . $url);

This way I force koken to access the website over the loopback. 
Is there a better way to correct this? It seems that `self::$protocol` should be detected from the php connection. </description>

I changed a hosting provider.
So I do the migration as you explain it :
- backup database from old server and restore it to the new.
- tar /var/www/koken_site and untar to the new server.

But I can't access to my home (www.andoromeda.fr) I have an Error 500.

      <title>E-Mail Contact form in Koken with copy sent to user</title>
      <description>Hello

I have a contact form setup for inquieries. Now if I don't respond in a timely manner many potential customers fill out the form again and ask if I didn't receive the E-Mail.

This is very annoying for both. Would it be possible to send a copy of the form to the user (E-Mail field is in the contact form)?

Kind regards

      <title>Problems Logging In &amp; Changing Settings</title>
      <description>Right after setting up Koken, I was not able to log into the admin dashboard. I tried reinstalling Koken, and the same issue occurred, I tried resetting my password and most times no email, except ONE time a message showed up saying "This email was not found." Then until I set "Keep me signed in," I was able to log in fine.

Then the welcome splash appeared, and I wasn't able to flip through any of the options at all, no response from the site, and none of the top links work at all. After 5 or 6 refreshes, finally the site became a bit response. Once going to the Settings to check things to change, going to Site Publishing -&gt; Page Title, I got an error saying I don't have privileges to alter this?

And still, I can't login without "Keep me signed in" checked, which is a security issue.</description>

I am hosting 2 Koken sessions on Microsoft Azure Web apps, which install fine. However when i try to upgrade i get the usual message "Koken was not able to download the new release. Try setting the permissions on the Koken directory and all subdirectories and files to 777."

      <title>Problem to understand how to instal Koken</title>
      <description>Hi,
I am trying to instal Koken.
Step 1&amp;2 are done. So I have basically created my database and downloaded the Koken folder.
I don't understand what to do for The step 3 :"Using an FTP client on your desktop, connect to your site and upload the /koken folder to the root of your domain." 
1) How do I use a FTP client on my desktop? How should I create one?
2) "connect to your site" means that I should connect to an old website of mine?
3) How do upload the folder to the root of my domain?
Thanks for your help

      <title>Re-applying theme settings</title>
      <description>Hi,

Are the settings stored in a plist/json file somewhere? I just duplicated my Axis theme and want to edit the templates, but it appears that first I have to entirely re-configure all aspects of the theme (image title instead of text; don't use slideshow, etc).

What would be great is if there is a file somewhere, even a technical file, that I can copy/paste to my new theme. I don't even see a way to ensure that I've made all the changes in the second theme that I made in the first (no way to compare or run through a list)... 

Is there a settings file I can hack or at least look at somewhere in the theme installation?

Thank you,

      <description>Hi, 
I have installed and bought a theme.  The process of posting stuff doesn't really look straight forward, and doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but my question is that can I make a site with a menu at left sidebar, and a slideshow at right which would change by clicking on the links, like www.paulbride.com which is a squarespace wells theme.  or like all these aphotofolio.com sites?
Thanks

      <description>Just installed Koken on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Install completes successfully but I can't get past the admin login unless I check the "keep me signed in" box. Once I login with that checked, I just get a blank, black screen with some unclickable links at the top.

Google developer console shows these errors:

      <title>Install fails at "Updating"...every time.</title>
      <description>4th or 5th attempt already after scouring Google and this board for answers...seems that others have had the same problem and some solved it by deleting the "migrations" folder per TeamNetOvjets' instructions, but I still get only the infinitely loading "Updating - The new version is now being installed." progress bar, which makes no progress even after over an hour of doing its thing.

What else to try?

      <title>Header layout inside pad on mobile</title>
      <description>Hello,

I have set the header inside pad to 100px as I donât want the logo and navigation to stretch to the full width - which works perfectly.

However the padding setting is also set on the mobile site - so the logo is half off the phone - I want the logo without padding on mobile, as is expected.

I have looked for mobile only code, and I cant seem to find any.

How can I keep the padding on desktop, which is very important, without pushing the mobile logo off the screen?

Much thanks.</description>

      <title>HTTP Error upload on NGINX</title>
      <description>So I was running into an issue where I was getting an error uploading after a new setup with Digital Ocean on LEMP. To resolve the issue you need to do the following:

1. Increase PHP limits by changing upload_max_filesize and post_max_filesize to your desired limit.
2. Set nginx to client_max_body_size 0; in your nginx.conf file.

Restart php-fpm and nginx services, and you should be good to go.

This is purely informational to anyone else running into this issue with NGINX, PHP and Koken. I did a lot of google searching and it took a bit of time to find this answer, especially on the NGINX component.</description>

      <description>Hello,

I wanted to ask how can I update the site description under my name when somebody google my website, for example. I attached a photo.

Is there anything that can be done? Do I have to wait 15-20 days in order for them to change how it appears as we google my name/website?

What kind of keywords should I include and how many?

Please download the sample photos from the following link:

      <title>Cart: Where are the buy buttons? They never appear.</title>
      <description>Despite numerous attempts I can't seem to locate the "buy" buttons or how to configure purchase options. Setup was a breeze, but finding the buttons is very frustrating.

Also, is it true that you can only use the "buy" function from gallery pages (and not blog posts) when it works? If so, super sad and I've just wasted $50. This plugin seems critically underdeveloped.</description>

      <description>Hi,

As far as i see, the installation process downloads directly the binaries from the web. Is it possible to have a bundle version of koken as my servers, on premises, don't have any access to the Internet.

Do you have any zip file containing the whole product or an alternative installation scheme using docker or similar approach?
