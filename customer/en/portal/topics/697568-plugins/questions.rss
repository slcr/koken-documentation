      <title>Hotjar</title>
      <description>Hi!

I cannot find a way to install a plugin to use hotjar or any other plugin. When I try to follow instructions I can't find where I should find it. I actually cannot find the plugin store, it shows me my Instagram photos instead. 

Thank you!</description>

      <title>Multi-language plugin</title>
      <description>Hi,
I wanted to share that I created a plugin that translates content in the browser - so no adaption of server-php code is necessary.
You can even extend your theme to contain a language selector.
Furthermore the plugin detects automatically the language of your visitor and sets automatically the apropritate language (or a fallback language if you didn't translate your page yet into the language of the visitor).
Last but not least the plugin makes your browser cache the language files so that they are not refetched on every page reload (if you select to do so in the plugin settings).
You can find more info about the plugin under https://cielitolindo.de/essays/2017/10/enable-multi-language-support-on-a-koken-site/</description>

      <title>Edit Visibility in Password Plugin...?</title>
      <description>After creating a Private album, I drag images to it.

Before the images are dropped into the folder, a message appears asking, "You are adding X public and unlisted items to a private album. Would you like to change the items to private?"

What difference does it make if I choose "No, leave them alone." or "Yes, make them private"? I can find nothing on this in Help.

All I want to do is to be able to send a link (password protected) to this album to a client for their private viewing.

Thanks.

      <title>Rating Plugin: Is it possible to Allow one user to add more than one like</title>
      <description>What i am actually looking for is a solution where my TfP models can not only tell me if they like an image or not but be a bit more specific. No heart could equal "please delete image", one heart could equal "image is OK", two hearts could equal "please send image with basic post" and three likes could equal "please postprocess this image".

I know i could try to activate disqus but then it would be active everywhere and i only need it in privatee albums.

Ideas anyone?</description>

      <title>Instagram plug-in won't connect</title>
      <description>Hi -

Instagram Plugin is enabled successfully.  When I go Library and try to import content using the plug-in, I get the import pop up window, and then click on the "Connect with Instagram" button.

However it just cycles a bit, then just stops and I am back on the same page - nothing has changed. Have tried reinstalling, but nothing changes.

Is there another step I must make to connect to my instagram act?    I have an SSL website, if that matters.
Thank you.. </description>

      <description>Hi, 

I just bought the Cart plugin. Despite all has been configured according the instruction and comments seen on this help center, I just can't get the cart icon to appear. I even re installed the plugin. Logged off, back on. Changed theme. No way to get it working.

Others seem to have their icons gone. Need help here.

      <description>Hello,

I'm following the instructions at http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/articles/1213488-add-a-favicon-to-your-site to add favicons to my site.  I've uploaded the images from iconifier to the root of my website (I can open them directly through a web browser).

When I try to add the code to the HTML Injector setup page I get an error telling me that the settings were not saved.

Any thoughts as to where things are going wrong?

      <title>Purchasable option not available in Library</title>
      <description>Hello
I recently purchased the Cart plugin and just finished setting up Stripe. I have configured the settings of the plugin and enabled live orders. But how do I mark the images purchasable. The only options I have in the Library module are; PROPERTIES, OWNERSHIP, SITE, HISTORY. So I seem to be missing the CART section. 

IÂ´m using the latest version of Axis 2 and Version 0.22.24 of Koken.

I also tried to rebuild the image cache, remove template caching. But nothing seems to work.

Ideas?

      <title>Password </title>
      <description>Hi guy's, very new to the system, but I have a very old cms system running on my server. Now I want to go and change to a different photoviewing and distribution system like koken. what I miss is, that yes I can protect my pictures or collections, but what about a client that wants a website with all their images but doesnt want to be listed under all the other users? is there any chance that I can give away users and passwords so that user xyz with password aaa will be directed to a different "under" website? or does anybody have a different solution?
I dont want my customers see that I have shot images for other customers, or weddings or etc..
any solution?

      <title>HTML Injector</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I'm using Koken for a while now. I just rebuild from the start a new version from my website with Boulevard2. Everything was fine until I installed the HTML Injector plugin. 

After the installation I was unable to save settings or uploaded pictures from the admin console. I tried to disable this plugin but the issue was still there. So I deleted it and now everything was fine again.

      <title>Rating Plugin and Google Rich Cards</title>

My question: How do I get the value out of the rating plugin?

      <title>Multiple Items / Item-specific option</title>
      <description>Hello!

Upon purchasing and installing the Cart plugin, I am disappointed to discover that the  "Cart" is not actually a shopping cart at all, but rather a method for purchase a single item. I thought that I must be doing something wrong, but a quick search reveals that in fact, the 'Cart" allows for placing only a singular item into it before check out is required to continue shopping. Additionally, it seems that there is no method of assigning item-specific options, for example, a specific print being available in several sizes, while a different print might be available in different sizes. 

It should surprise no one that in most cases I prefer my customers to purchase multiple items which seem to bring in more revenue than selling a single item and frequently, in photography and fine art, the proportions of a specific image lend themselves only to specific sizes which differ somewhat from image to image. 

I would like to think I;m missing something here but alas, it seems that the Cart is not a cart after all. Virtually by definition, a cart is something only required for multiple items. Please let me know when I might expect the cart to accommodate multiple items, and item-specific options and pricing. Without these seemingly very basic features, the cart seems unusable to me.

Thanks!</description>

      <title>Cart plugin - different items to sell</title>
      <description>I'm using Cart for selling prints and have two price options for different sizes. Now I have also published a book and want to sell it through the website. So I added two different prices for book depending on delivery options. Can I assign only the relevant prices to the book (represented by a photo of the book) but not all the possible options which also include price for prints. At the moment it shows all 4 different options for prints and books.

      <title>Watermark on Download images and Cart</title>
      <description>Hi,

A couple of queries and how 2 plugins work together for the 2nd query..

Firstly,
Does the watermark still remain on images you have enabled for download. I have mine set to download the original size image. Will the applied watermark remain on the downloaded copy? I hope yes.

Secondly,
If I install both watermark plugin and the Cart. Will the watermark be applied to site images only but the purchased image (download) be clean / the original image with no watermark?

I have the password protect plugin, and I want to enable the download just for the password protected area.
For example:
Album A : public part, without password, download disable
Album B : same images, but in a private album, with password, with download enable.
For the moment, same images are in both album, but the download attribute is shared between these 2 albums. An option of download attribute by album is possible?
Thanks for your answer!

      <description>Is there a way to change the default Koken Cart icon that displays when a user rolls over an image?  The default logo really doesn't symbolize "Purchase" or "Buy Now".  Ultimately, I would like to change it to a "$" - that might help people understand to click the button to purchase.

      <title>Image Protector is easy to bypass...</title>
      <description>While it prevents you from right-clicking on an image, all you need to do is right-click on any other part of the page and select "View Source."

Scroll down to the "window.theContent" area and you will see the easily readable URL for the image.

Anyone with basic HTML knowledge would be able to download the full uploaded resolution of your image.

Any plans on fixing this? I was about to purchase the plug-in but this is a bummer.</description>

      <title>Flickr...</title>
      <description>Good Morning!
I switched to Koken some time ago, hoping that the system would evolve and that more support for external sources would be realized with plugins.
I miss, for example, a comfortable integration of Flickr. Now, every CMS, only Koken does not.
When will you offer such a thing?

      <title>easy hotlinking</title>
      <description>Hi,

Since Photobucket had the brilliant idea of stopping 3rd party hosting, unless you pay them 399$ a year, I want a personal space, where I can store my photos, but can share them easily. 

The Koken Gallery is working fine, uploading is easy. But I am not finding a plugin that shows me easy to copy share links, that I can use on several Forums and sites. I have searched the Plugin library, but could not find a plugin that can help me. 

Ideally, the plugin will put a custom link underneath the shown photo, with the physical location, so that I can put that link in image brackets on forum. This way I will have total control over my photos and as long as I pay my own site fees, no company will thrash my forumthreads. :)

Hope there is something out there, that already has this feature, or hope someone is willing and able to make a plugin that will do exactly this. :)

Thanks in advance for the help. :)

      <title>Stripe Plugin: Giropay, SEPA Direct Debit and SOFORT </title>
      <description>Hi Koken Team,

Stripe now offers Giropay, SEPA Direct Debit and SOFORT as payment options.
Is it planned to integrate these options into the Cart Plugin?
Furthermore, it would be great if it would also be possible to use Braintree and Stripe parallel (depending on the chosen payment option).</description>

      <title>Image Protector Pluigin in custom theme</title>
      <description>Hey Koken Team,

I would like to use the Image Protector Plugin from the Koken Store on my page. Before I buy the 
plugin though I was hoping that there is a way of confirming that it will work in a custom designed theme. 

In my theme images are loaded via koken:load and koken:img and placed within a figure-tag. Now I'm not sure how the Protector plugin targets the images it should protect and whether i would need to change my markup structure.

Let me know if you need more information.
Cheers
Lukas

      <title>Cart Plugin: does it support collecting state based sales tax (via either payment provider)?</title>
      <description>Hi,

I'm looking into using the Koken and the Cart Plugin to market fine art prints of my work. In order to do so and when shipping within the US state I live in, I need to collect sales tax. Does the Cart Plugin support this scenario via either payment provider, based on the shipping address of the customer?

Is there more extensive and detailed documentation around the Cart Plugin and its integration with either payment platform? I'd like to understand this better before I make a decision towards Koken and the Cart Plugin.

Many thanks,

I have two Instagram accounts. And would like to import from both. But if I try to switch by disconnecting in the settings and connecting to a different, koken choses automatically again the first. 
Anything to do about it?

      <title>Image protector </title>
      <description>Hello, 

I just purchased a license to use Image Protector, and am very disappointed it does not seem to work with the PhotoSwipe plugin. 

Any work-around for this? 

PhotoSwipe is much more elegant than the native slide show in Oxygen 2.3.2.

Or if you can make another suggestion. 

Thanks,

      <title>Details about cart</title>
      <description>Dear ladies and gentleman,

i'm really interested in using the "Cart"-Plugin. So here are my final questions before buying the product:

- I'm located in Germany. Are german print media suppliers adapted?
- Is it possible to set a password protection for some albums / galeries?
- Can I send a news mail to every registered customer?

Thanks for your support and have a nice day.

Sincerely,
Manuel Pape

      <title>after upgrading to 0.22.23  store and plugins links don't work</title>
      <description>Hi 

After upgrading to 0.22.23 it says my installation needs to be upgraded after clicking on plugins or store links.

Then if I say yes to the upgrade even though I know its already upgraded it says there is a problem and I'm getting downgraded.

Then if I look at version under Settings/Console its not downgraded! 

Can you please advise how to get into plugins and Store again since upgrading to 0.22.23 .

THanks

My password protected albums, due to their visibility set as "private" do not appear on the Albums page, they are only accessible with a direct link... I was wondering if there is a way to present them on the Albums page (showing their assigned cover) and redirecting to the password page when the user clicks on them ?

      <title>Email plugin modded to solve a problem.</title>
      <description>Today I faced a problem with the email plugin because I misunderstood how it is supposed to work. Maybe someone else has the same problem.
The email plugins when used in smtp mode setup the sender and the destination email to the same address. The problem is when you setup an account for sending email to another account you look everyday.
I've edited the plugin adding an SMTP sender address used in the send process and now it works flawlessly.

in plugin.php change from:
-&gt;setFrom(array($toEmail))
to:
-&gt;setFrom(array($this-&gt;data-&gt;smtp_from_email))

and in plugin.json add:
,
		"smtp_from_email": {
			"type": "string",
			"header": "Sender address",
			"info": "Set the sender address",
			"dependencies": {
				"evaluate": "all",
				"conditions": [
					{
						"option": "provider",
						"equals": "smtp"
					}
				]
			}
		}

That's all!

With the cart plugin installed, It would be a very nice feature if custom prices options would be 'per item' selectable. I personally have gift cards, prints, and digital download to sell and gift card is for example not appropriate on a print order to appear. Would it be possible to have a look for future versions ?

I'm currently using test api keys and the suggested strip cards for testing.
https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards

My question is, I don't get a file delivery/download action to follow the test purchase.
Is this because of test mode? Also is there is a way to check out at one time with several
images or is it one at a time.

When I import the photos, resolution is only 640x640.
And also, all the imported photos are in a square format. 
But on Instagram, resolution is more than 640x640 and there is photos in a non-square format.
Is it something that will be fix soon ?

Thanks for your answer,
And congrats for this product, finally I will be able to have a nice portfolio!

      <title>Transfer</title>
      <description>Hello,

I need to change my web hosting : moving from a starter plan to a VPS from another provider.
How does migration impact my Koken purchases ? (I purchased the Password Protect plugin). I guess I have to keep the same domain name since it appears as an "Installation" in my account. Am I right ? Is there any other point I should be aware of before proceding ?

Regards,
Matt.</description>

      <title>custom text next to rating?</title>
      <description>I just bought the rating plugin, it works as expected, however I would like to add/modify the way the rating looks next to the photo. For now it's just a heart which doesn't really scream "click me to rate" so I'm trying to add some text like "Rate: " or something that guides the viewer to click it. Unfortunately, I cannot do this using CSS ::before or ::after tags since the plugin uses those and I cannot modify the theme since it's purchased. I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on how I can customize the way this plugin looks. 

Thanks!

      <title>Photograph not showing as Content?</title>
      <description>I've just added a photograph  to my Koken site and, while the image is appearing in its assigned album (Photography), it isn't showing up as content  this a result of an upper limit to the number of images allowable to be displayed as 'content', or some other issue?

      <title>Rating plugin with Regale 2 theme does not work</title>
      <description>Hi,

I use Koken 22.18 version with Regale 2 theme and I just added Rating plugin. In Library view when I select any of photos I can see Rating section on the setting section on the right. But there is only "Times rated" in this section. There is no "Show ratings" option as shown in koken plugin page at https://store.koken.me/plugins/rating. My web site is www.ercanuc.com.

In my site, I can only see heart symbol when I select an album, then select an individual photo and then click it again for lightbox view. So visitors can not see heart symbol to click when they see thumbnails on any albums.

Could you please let me know how I can see "Show ratings" option in settings; how I can show times rated under/on each photos.

Thanks and regards,
Ercan</description>

      <title>Why is the Image Protector Plugin so limited in it's functions?</title>
      <description>Hi

Considering to buy more plugins to enhance site for more interaction. However, there is one matter that bothers me a lot of its restrictions. Actually, I have asked this questions already over a year ago, and not much has happened since then. As well I noticed of other koken users pinpointing to the same matter. For example, other photography cms solution e.g. Photoshelter, ProPhoto etc - make this option possible ... 

Why is it not possible to exclude watermarks of specific images for promotion purposes on SoMe? It would be great to exclude the generation of image watermarks on specific images, e.g. splash images. This could be based on tags or on a new property for image file ("Do not watermark").

Looking forward for feedback. Thanks

      <title>Instagram plug-in not working</title>
      <description>Hi - Just purchased the Instagram plug-in and installed and set it up.  But just hangs when I try to import images from my account.  

Another odd thing is under Settings/Plug-Ins/Instagram Set-up I see that (after I connected to my Instagram act) there is no Disconnect button.  Nothing in the space where, I believe, it should be.

Checked my Instagram act on their site and it does list Koken as an authorized application.  

Also I have a SSL site.  Could that be causing the problem?</description>

      <title>image-protector: partial access</title>
      <description>Hello there,

Recently, I bought the image-protector plugin.
Is it possible to set it such that when a photo is shared to twitter (for example like https://twitter.com/chitlesh/status/828727984353845248) or facebook, a small version of the photo is shared instead of only the link without image? 
I still wish to that the right-click protection together with the protection for large files.

regards,

      <description>Hello Guys,

Wanted to ask if I can use Cart Plug to sell not only prints and photos, but also video products or lets say I create a Christmas Promotion Deal/Offer. I attach a photo with a text explaining my offering. Is it possible with this Card Plugin to sell things/products/photography services online? Or alternatively people to book me for a photo shoot and pay a 30% deposit in advance?

I attached a photo to better illustrate my point.

      <title>Trouble with VIMEO-Playback</title>
      <description>Hi,

I have some trouble with my Koken-built-website playing videos. I am using the VIMEO-plugin and MADISON 2 theme. Some videos have an "audio echo" and pressing the "pause" button in the player window makes the video stop, but the audio ist playing on. It seems there are playing two audio tracks with delay but there is only one in the video.

I am using:

MAC OS 10.11.6
SAFARI 10.0.3

Autoplay - ON
Show Title ON - does not work also...

Can you help me, please?

      <title>Cart / multiple items</title>
      <description>I've just installed Cart, set up Stripe, made a few custom items to order and seem to have it working ok.  What I can't see is how people add multiple images to the cart before paying.  I have an event page with 300 images, some people will want to select 4 or 5 images then check out.  It looks to me like they have to go through the purchase procedure for each item - am I missing something?</description>
