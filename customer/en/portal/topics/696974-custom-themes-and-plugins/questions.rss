      <title>Responsive</title>
      <description>Hello, 

I made some changes on the ensemble theme in a way that the "contact" and the "work" links will be visible anywhere you are in the site &gt;&gt; http://maevaexposito.com/. I like the result on a laptop screen but I don't know how to code the css to make it as it was before on a smartphone screen. Can you help me please ?

      <title>2 (or more) differents template for album pages</title>
      <description>Hey Koken,

Following this discussion (http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/1066069-2-or-more-differents-template-for-albums-pages) from 2013, I would like to know if some tools has been developed in order to be able to have two (or more) differents templates for an album to display. Typically, I have stories in which I would like to use Pulse and two folios I would like to display like as contact sheets. I think I might be able to do something through the section tricks but I'll have to duplicate the code and template for each section (two for now), hardcode the section's name and any modification will have to be duplicated as well.

So any news ? :)

Thanks anyway for the good work you put in this,

Best regards,

      <title>Plugin creating image attributes</title>
      <description>I wish to create a plugin adds an attribute (checkbox) to the settings of an image, which I'd then be able to modify how it is displayed. I can't find a way to do this nicely within the system.

I can do it using something similar to shortcodes in the description, but it's not quite as nice as I'd like.

Am I correct in that there is no way for a plugin to add things to the image configuration in admin?</description>

      <description>Hello, I'm wondering if there's a nice non-hacky way to have a setting with a textfield instead of a single-line textbox.

From my research it seems there is not, which is unfortunate, and I'm hoping I've just missed something.</description>

      <title>Custom counter for Pulse</title>
      <description>Hi Folks,

Thanks for creating this awesome portfolio system.  I have successfully customized a template to work in a website with an existing theme.  You can see it at http://granthays.com Koken is only being used for the pages under the "portfolio" dropdown menu.  I have added a pulse player for viewing an album of images for any project.  I would like to add a custom counter underneath the Pulse player indicating "1 of 23", "2 of 23", etc.

I think this is possible for looking at the Pulse documentation, but I am hoping someone has already created such a useful counter already.  i was unable to find one on the pages of example code.  If it does not exist, can you tell me what properties I should be collecting from pulse to make that happen?

Thanks for any info,

      <title>Add content tags automatically</title>
      <description>Hello.

Is there a way to automatically add tags to the images via javascript?

I was thinking of something like:

if ({{ content.aspect_ratio }}&gt;1){
    {{ content.tags }} = "horizontal";
}
else{
   {{ content.tags}} = "vertical";
}


Thanks in advance.

      <title>Pulse not loading</title>
      <description>Hey, I'm trying to add pulse to a custom template I'm making. I've went through every different way I can think of to add it to my template but it doesn't load at all. I've even looked at the source code of the published website and pulse isn't there at all.

What else should I do? I've tried other templates and it works fine.</description>

      <title>Lens API in a React.js component?</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I've been wondering if it'd be possible to create a custom template based on React.js (or Vue.js, etc...).

As far as I got since the Lens API allows to use some custom HTML tags my guess is that they can be passed into JSX, but I've got a feeling that then they won't be rendered properly or it will affect the page performance.
I was thinking to add a plugin to load up the JS bundle generated in React, if necessary.

Is that feasible? Has somebody ever experienced a solution like that?

Many Thanks

I just bought the vimeo-plugin, enabled it, filled in my vimeo-name, but the name is not accepted, so i canÂ´t save the settings and import my videos via the plugin.

I have a modest budget for the work, please do get in touch if you think you might be able to help. Even if its just discussing what is or is not possible!

Thanks,

      <title>Linking from an album to the content</title>
      <description>Hello there,

I got a koken website up and running as a portfolio for my architecture stuff. I'm using the Ensemble-theme, because it fittest the best for me. --&gt; https://kmm-architect.com

If you go to "portfolio" you can see a list of albums, within the set "portfolio". If you click an album, it's going to open the album with it's pictures. And if you click a picture it links to another page (content), with the picture itself and small thumbnails at the bottom. 

What I try to do is: you click on "portfolio", see the list of all albums, and when you click at the album it opens the content-page with the small thumbnails directly. I tried redirecting it with js in the footer, but as you know, that's just a quick and dirty solution.

I figured out, that the set.lens file includes the file "inc/loop-album-grid.html", in which the link is set to "{{ album.title }}". So I thought I might have to change something there.
I read many articles here, but I can't figure it out by myself.

with best regards
Kay

      <description>Hello,

I'm working on a custom contact page, but when I try to reupload the .lens file via FTP, the page does not update in the browser. While trying to figure out the issues, I decided to just delete the .lens file from the server, and remove it from the site in the admin panel. After doing that, the page still loads in the browser. 

How can I update/remove this page? The url is http://photo.cdtownley.com/contact/

I tried to set up a function to limit the rendered images to one. The thing is that now I don't know how set up another function to render the rest of the images without rendering again the first one.

Any suggestions?

      <title>Breadcrumbs</title>
      <description>Is there a way to disable breadcrumbs on album pages?

And if not, is there a way for the breadcrumbs to match link renaming?
For instance I prefer "galleries" over "albums" so I renamed the "Album" page to "galleries". But on the breadcrumb it clearly lists "Albums".
It would be great to be able to edit that and it would be even better to totally disable it.</description>

      <title>API Cache - Laragon</title>
      <description>Hi,

I'm using Laragon for local development. Initially there was an issue with the error "blocking loopback connections" https://forum.laragon.org/topic/402/loopback-requests

However, using ngrok has seemed to resolve some of this and I am able to load the web page. Unfortunately, images - served by the i.php script - are failing to load.

I've cleared the storage\cache\api folder so it is trying to load a valid URL but it seems to be just timing out and failing.

Have you tested the platform on Laragon/ngrok, this is a fairly common development setup.
Do you have any ideas how this can be resolved? Is it possible to disable the loopback loading for local development? Any plans to refactor this code in favour of a service layer?

Many thanks for any help.</description>

      <title>Mapbox integration</title>
      <description>Hi!

I'm thinking of trying to use Koken as a backend for my archive / personal stock site.
I've seen people do attempts at mapbox integrations. I might find friends who could do the coding but I'm trying to first map out if its even possible.

I've seen in some posts that its only possible to retreive the data up to 100 pictures? I'm thinking it might eventually grow into an archive of 10-20000 photos. It would need to be a system that somehow progressively loads the images on the map.  Tagging is also a must but using the data from geotags for searching would be the best option.</description>

Quick question with the Regale 2 theme.  I'd like to use the mobile navigation as the main nav in desktop.  Is there a simple way to do this?  Or would I have to copy and edit the  theme?  Is it possible to inject custom code in there to get this working or would that break the theme?

Thanks!

      <title>Showing album content (images) outside of the album page.</title>
      <description>I'm trying to display a little thumbnail images from each album. Basically all images from the album and a link to them via anchor tag. I thought that could be easily done using albums.lens, but through countless experiments with tags I did not find anything that would simply do just that. Apparently you Koken doesn't allow loading content of the albums outside of album page. BUT, it does allow loading covers. 

So my solution was to assign each photo as a cover :D

If I'm missing something, please let me know. </description>

It's been a couple of years since I made a custom theme, but I'm current working on a new one. I'm trying to get the Album title and description in my content page. I'd guess koken:parent would be of use here, but I can't get it to work. I can't find anything in the documentation and I'm to rusty to figure it out by myself. I'm hoping anyone here can help out.
Thanks is advance!</description>

      <title>Php counter shows up in admin but on the public page</title>
      <description>Hello everyone,

i made a counter in php and added it via the include tag in a lens file.
the php script uses a textfile to read and change the amount of visitors.

after taking it productive and browsing it as a visitor it keeps showing:
Visitors: 000000

But in the admin panel i see the correct amount.
Visitors: 000123

So anyone know how to fix this ?

I appreciate any helpful answer.

thanks for reading.

Bes regards
Marcus

      <title>Question regarding Map of content</title>
      <description>Hey there!

As usually Koken works fine. But I would add a functionality to my website. A map of content.

NOT a map of all images which is boring for me (for my website I mean). But I would create a unique map displayed on the homepage showing where ALBUMS and ESSAYS are in the map.
It mean, write or select GPS coordinate directly in an album or essay, then display them on the map.

Does anybody tried to do something like this? The actual function could be also available in essays or albums... Could be great!

Thanks in advance</description>

I tried to adjust the image size in my abum via the settings.css.lens file from 100% to 40%  online 561:

img.content {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 40%;
    max-height: 800px;
    height: auto;

It works well when I use a browser based preview, but when I change the original css file and upload it nothing happens.

Any ideas?

      <title>Madison theme - Bug?</title>
      <description>Hello Koken Team,

Here is my question:

I am using madison theme 2.7. (the latest version I guess) and probably I just discovered a bug or something like that!

It would be very useful for SEO purposes to change the source code to load by default the description field and not the summary, in library properties. 

I just tested it and it seems to load the summary even though the description is filled out with descriptive text.

I think, it would be more interesting to make the theme loading the description field by default in the body  ...  to be able to see albums descriptions in front end of the site, which makes sense, actually. 

For better SEO, it seems to be very helpful to make the summary field loading in the  ...  of  madison theme.

I hope I did explain the issue clearly. 

Can you help on that issue or give some advise where to rewrite the code to make those changes work for us?

Please let us know and many thanks in advance.

      <title>Different renders with the same page (album.lens) but with different albums</title>
      <description>Hi everybody,

I'm customing my own koken theme and  I've got an odd issue I cannot explain.
On one URL (http://tien-tran.com/albums/combrailles/) everything is fine.
On the other one (http://tien-tran.com/albums/commande/), the slideshow (powered by pulse) is tiny and not centered.

What is strange is the fact that they are both based on album.lens, so the same code.

I flushed the cache, check any differences between the two album (file size, title description) but I cannot find anything. Do you have any idea ?

Thank you in advance,

      <title>Looking for someone to do tech support for custom koken site</title>
      <description>I built a custom site (theme based off Boulevard) for a client some years ago using Koken. I am now retiring from web world and wanna find someone who could manage the site and give the client support when needed if any problems occur. Preferably someone who has experience in CSS, HTML, JS, and Koken markup. The theme cannot be updated since it was heavily customized and edits would be lost if it did. Console hasn't been updated either since 2012. My experience with the console updates has been that it breaks the site almost every time, since the theme is likely no longer compatible with the latest version of console. So it's a tricky situation, but the site has been running mostly fine with no problems for several years. Anyone feeling up for this, please respond with your contact info. The pay is between $25-50/hr. </description>

      <title>build image cache doesn't create tiny crops</title>
      <description>Hi,

if i read here "http://help.koken.me/customer/portal/questions/16700196-performance-related", the function "build image cache" should build all the needed image sizes, who are used in the theme. 

Unfortunately it doesn't create the tiny crops i use in my custom templates, e. g. here "http://www.foto-mg.com/portfolio/33/". That's a problem for me, because then the processor create the tiny crops on demand if a user click on the site. Therefore the tiny crops are often pixelated.

Is there a possibility, that the "build image cache" option also create the tiny crops i need?

Thanks.</description>

      <title>Video Player without FFMPEG, Customize html head in Madison</title>
      <description>Hello,

1. Video Player without FFMPEG
Since installing FFMPEG is a pain i. t. a., I suggest you simply provide 2 extra fields in the app:
one for thumbnail specification/upload 
one for an alternative .ogv version of the video
THIS IS SIMPLE, I already set it up this way with another CMS. Mediaelementplayer can be fully customized.

2. Customize html head in Madison
Exactely which is the file in Madison where one can customize the html head section. I want to get rid of a number of links/meta-tags e.g. the rss links and add other. Could you please provide me with a path?

Thanks,

      <description>I'm using Regale 2 and want to have one album have a slideshow instead of showing all the images at once.

Is there a way for a page to act as an album or automatically load when the an album cover is selected? </description>

      <title>Empty CSS box</title>
      <description>Hi,

I would like to edit the theme I am using but there is neither with the "elementary" nor with the "ensemble" theme any code shown to edit. It's just empty.

Do I have to add it somehow or am I using it wrong?

Thanks in advance!

      <title>How to List all Sets</title>
      <description>I've structured my library so albums with a common subject are grouped into sets. I want to create a page where visitors can select one of these sets and it then shows all albums within that set.

Is there any lens tag or similar that will output all the top level set names for me? I can't seem to find one.</description>

      <title>How can I highlight parent elements of current album in navigation menus?</title>
      <description>Is it possible to get menu routing to work in koken or am I just missing something?
So for example I have an album called "Dogs" nested in a set called "Animals". The set is part of my main navigation. Now when I am viewing "Dogs" I want its parent set "Animals" to be highlighted too (".k-nav-current" class applied)

What I have tried so far is to use the nested="true" attribute in the  lens tag, but this did not work.

I am using this in a custom theme which is based on the Elementary theme.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!</description>

      <title>How can I request with koken:img and a given preset</title>
      <description>I am using the koken:img lens tag with one of the pre-defined preset values in order to get a certain size of the picture. Is it possible to explicitely request the retina version of a picture when using a preset?

      <title>Koken Plugin Shortcode</title>
      <description>Hi

I wrote a plugin a while ago:

https://github.com/bigflannel/bigflannel-Slideshow-Embed-Koken-Plugin

It seems to work well, I do however have one issue, when one user embeds a slideshow, the shortcode added to the essay looks like this:

[bigflannel_slideshow_embed album="15"]"]

not like this:

[bigflannel_slideshow_embed album="15"]

The slideshow displays on the public page for the essay, but is followed "]. When returning to the essay in Koken admin, the slideshow is listed in the essay as undefined.

I've looked at my code and I don't seem to have any control over the shortcode code / placement etc.

Any advice greatly appreciated. My user is using Koken 22.5 and bigflannel Slideshow Embed 1.05. I can't reproduce it, but have worked on my user's installation and it is repeatable in that context.

Regards
Mike

      <title>Custom site titles depending on domain</title>
      <description>Dear Koken Team, 

I have a small question - i have 2 different domains - both pointing to the same server and directory. I only want to swap the title depending of the url the visitor came in ( via php $_SERVER vars ) 
Is there a possibility yo hack this somewhere into the code? i have not found where the settings  from the Database will be fetched. if you just point me to the file i can fiddle out the rest myself. 

Thanks a lot! </description>

      <title>Can't upload a custom theme or free plugin to server into directory "../koken/storage/"</title>
      <description>I just tried to upload a custom theme (blueprint-master) to my server (using a FTP connection). But it seems that I don't have the permission (!?) to write something into the remote folder "../koken/storage/". Neither to /themes nor to /plugins subfolder. How can I install my custom theme oder a free plugin (i.e. https://www.brisoft.de/en/insert-images-essays-posts/)?

B.t.w: creation of folders or files in /koken directory directly is possible!

Thanks in advance

      <title>Call Lightbox with the same content as the calling tag (pulse or page context)</title>
      <description>Hi,

          I've created a custom lens including a koken:pulse with option:
                        link_to="lightbox"

          However, when the lightbox is opened it load all the contents and not only the contents loaded in pulse tag. And more than the predefined data source of the lens.

           Did I miss something in the configuration? How works the lightbox to determine which content it displays?

Thank you.

      <title>Responsive background-image and image</title>
      <description>Hello everybody,

I'm trying to put a responsive background on my portfolio. It is quite big (1500px wide), but I don't succeed in auto resize (tablet, mobile). On the laptop view when I put background-size:100% it becomes kind of blurry background instead of sizing full and not bigger.

Secondly, I'd like to include in the HTML header file some images (above the background image) but they aren't resizing when I reduce the view. I wrote :

But no success..

Thank you so much

      <title>Import your pictures from Eyeem</title>
      <description>Hello all,
I would like to share with you a little php script that i have done recently : Eyeem2koken.
The aim of it is to import your pictures from Eyeem to your koken installation.

All you need to get it is available here : https://github.com/pnizet/eyeem2koken and it's free

Just upload the files to your server, setup up is really easy and (almost) automatic, you can use it to import all you pictures or you can import one picture at at a time  (or you can use it with cron to import automatically)....

      <title>Delivering retina images with koken:asset</title>
      <description>Hello everybody,
I am currently developing a custom theme for Koken, but struggling to deliver retina images using koken:asset. There seems to be no option to do this, and the tag itself doesn't seem to deliver @2x (or @3x) versions automatically.

Retina images work fine using koken:img, but this can only be used to deliver gallery images, not theme-related images.

How can this be achieved?
Thanks,

      <description>Is it possible to make new navigation groups (from info.json) to show up WITHOUT reapplying theme or resetting links?
After reapplying and resetting customisations in navigation are cleared.
This is very annoying, because then all navigation must be recreated.</description>

      <title>Customizing Breadcrumb Links</title>
      <description>I'm setting up Koken as a private clients gallery site using password protected folders. I'm making changes to a copied version of Elementary. 

When a user logs into their set with their password, they get a view of albums and can open one. In either that album or in the set of albums, having them click a link that goes to all albums is pointless. I replaced the breadcrumbs album_header_title.html with {{ album.url }} to see if I can get the right url. On the sets page, it outputs domain.com/sets/name-of-a-set, which is perfect for the set's page displaying albums and would be perfect above each album so a user can navigate back to the set's page displaying albums. On the album page, it outputs domain.com/albums/name-of-an-album. 

 I also tried album.title, but there's no version of that variable that replaces spaces with dashes so I could use it  in a link like src="sets/{{ album.title }}". I could re-generate the url based on album.title by replacing the spaces in the output text with dashes, but there must be a better way.

How can simply add a link back to the domain.com/sets/name-of-a-set page?</description>

I would like to show the categories or the tags on the hover text in order that the viewer can click on them and he becomes shown all the pictures under this category/tag. I also would like to show tags when you hover over the top menu text.
Here is a site to get the idea http://joaocanziani.com/
